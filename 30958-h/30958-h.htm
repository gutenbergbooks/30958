<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>A GREAT STREAK OF LUCK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Anybody home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, walk right in, Toby. My latch-string is always out to my chums.
I see you managed to pick up Steve on the way across; but I wager you had really
to pry him loose from that dandy new volume on travel he was telling me about,
because he&#8217;s such a bookworm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys who hastened to accept this warm invitation, and enter Jack
Winters&#8217; snug &#8220;den&#8221; were his most particular chums. Those who
have been lucky enough to read the preceding volume of this series<a
id='FNanchor_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1' class='fnanchor'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
will of course require no introduction to Steve Mullane and Toby Hopkins.
However, as many newcomers may for the first time be making the acquaintance of
the trio in these pages, it might be just as well to enumerate a few of their
leading characteristics, and then we can get along with our story.</p>

<p>Steve was a pretty husky fellow, a bit slow about making up his mind, but
firm as adamant, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span> once
he had convictions. He had proved himself a wonder as a backstop in the
thrilling baseball contests so lately played with Harmony, the champion team of
the county. Indeed, it was due in great part to his terrific batting, and
general field work that the Chester nine came out of those contests, under Jack
Winters&#8217; leadership, with such high honors.</p>

<p>Toby Hopkins was something of a genius in many ways, a nervous sort of a boy,
and really deserving of his familiar nickname of &#8220;Hoppy&#8221; for short.
All the same, he was game to the core, and would never acknowledge himself
whipped as long as he could draw a decent breath. Toby ardently admired Jack,
and believed there never was another such born leader as the fellow who had
&#8220;placed Chester on the map&#8221; of outdoor sports.</p>

<p>Jack Winters had not always lived in this same town of Chester. When his
folks came there from an enterprising place, he had been shocked to discover how
little genuine interest the boys seemed to take in football, baseball, and all
such healthy recreations.</p>

<p>Jack had been accustomed to enjoying everything that had a tendency to arouse
a lad&#8217;s ambition to excel in all healthy exercises calculated to be of
benefit to both mind and body. He soon proved to be the much-needed &#8220;cake
of yeast in a pan of dough,&#8221; as Toby always declared, for he succeeded in
arousing the dormant spirit of sport <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_3'></a>3</span> in the Chester boys, until finally the mill town
discovered that it did not pay any community to indulge in a Rip Van Winkle
sleep.</p>

<p>And now that the seed had taken root, and Chester was fully awake, some of
her most enterprising citizens were promising to take up the subject of a
gymnasium and boys&#8217; club-house, where the young lads of the town could,
under the management of a physical director, have a proper place to spend their
spare hours with profit to themselves.</p>

<p>Vacation had not as yet made any serious inroads on their summer season, and
for some little time now Jack and his two best chums had been trying to figure
out some scheme that would occupy a couple of weeks, and give them the outing
they were hungering for.</p>

<p>All sorts of ideas had cropped up, but thus far nothing seemed to have caught
their fancy to such an extent that their enthusiasm ran wild. It was just at
this interesting stage of the game that Jack had called to the others over the
&#8217;phone, to ask them to drop in at his place that evening after supper, and
hinting after a boyish fashion that he might have something &#8220;real
interesting&#8221; to discuss with them.</p>

<p>Familiarity with Jack&#8217;s den caused both the visitors to lose no time in
seating themselves in favorite seats. Steve threw himself haphazard upon an old
but comfortable lounge, tossing his cap at the same time toward a rack on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span> wall, and chuckling
triumphantly when by sheer luck it stuck on a peg.</p>

<p>Toby curled up in the depths of a huge Morris chair that had been discarded
as unworthy of a place in the living-room downstairs, and to which in due season
Jack had naturally fallen heir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ve strolled over this evening in response to your call,
Jack,&#8221; observed Steve, with one of his wide grins, &#8220;and full to the
brim with expectancy, as well as supper. Suppose you unload and tell us what
you&#8217;ve struck this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, spin the yarn, please, Jack, because I&#8217;m fairly quivering
with suspense, you must know,&#8221; urged Toby, with a vein of entreaty in his
voice.</p>

<p>Jack laughed. He knew that while the others were trying to appear cool,
inwardly both of them were boiling with curiosity and eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the conundrum is solved, I reckon,&#8221; he went on to say;
&#8220;that is, if both of you agree with me that this chance is something like
a gift dropped from the blue sky. We made up our minds a long time ago that it
must be some sort of outing for us this summer, and the only thing that looked
dubious was the state of our funds, and they have been drained pretty low, what
with buying so many things needed for our sports. Well, that part of it has been
settled. A magician bobbed up just when we needed one the worst kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve no longer reclined at full length on the lounge; he sat up straight and
turned a pair of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
dancing eyes on the speaker. As for Toby, he actually leaped out of the depths
of his chair, and threatened to execute a Fiji Island war-dance on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, tell us some more, please,&#8221; urged Steve. &#8220;Who is
this kind gentleman who has taken such an interest in our crowd that he&#8217;d
actually offer to stand for the expense of our outing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place,&#8221; Jack explained, &#8220;strange as you
may think it, it happens that it isn&#8217;t a gentleman at all, but a lady who
offers to pay for everything we&#8217;ll need, to have the greatest camping trip
of our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Re-markable!&#8221; gurgled Toby Hopkins. &#8220;Well, all I can say
is that I&#8217;m more than surprised. But it&#8217;s mighty evident to me that
she does this because of the admiration she feels for our chum, Jack Winters;
and I guess, Steve, once more we&#8217;re lucky to have such a general favorite
for a comrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, fellows,&#8221; remonstrated Jack, hastily, &#8220;there are
several reasons why the lady is doing this for us. One of them is admiration for
the way we acquitted ourselves in the baseball games lately played. She has a
healthy regard for the proper bringing up of boys, though she has never been
married herself, and therefore knows them only from hearsay. She is interested
in the projected gymnasium, and means to invest some of her means in the
enterprise, believing that it will pay enormous dividends to the young people of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span> this community. But
you mustn&#8217;t ask me for her name, because I am not at liberty to mention it
even to you fellows just yet. Later on the promise of secrecy may be withdrawn,
after we&#8217;ve come back from our trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is another reason for her generosity besides the desire to
reward a select few of the Chester nine on account of their good work on the
diamond, eh, Jack?&#8221; asked Steve, persistently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I own up to that,&#8221; he was told, &#8220;but that&#8217;s
also a secret for the present. She has made one provision which is that we are
to take a quantity of pictures of the region while there, and that will
certainly be an easy way of returning her kindness, especially since she stands
sponsor for everything, and we are not limited to the amount of our
expenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! that sounds like a fairy story, Jack,&#8221; breathed Toby,
entranced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take it,&#8221; continued the wise Steve, &#8220;that if she wants
certain pictures of the region for some reason or other, the camping country has
already been settled on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it has, and I hope you&#8217;ll both be pleased when I tell you
we are going up into the Pontico Hills region, with a horse and covered wagon,
hired from Tim Butler&#8217;s livery stable, to carry all our stuff
along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very place I&#8217;ve always wanted to spend a spell in!&#8221;
ejaculated Steve, exultantly. &#8220;It&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_7'></a>7</span> surely a wild region, and a better camping place
couldn&#8217;t be picked out, no matter how long you tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby, too, seemed delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose now, Jack,&#8221; he presently remarked, shrewdly,
&#8220;this unknown lady friend of yours doesn&#8217;t want it known that any
one is backing us in our trip?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is understood,&#8221; he was informed speedily enough. &#8220;Of
course our folks must know where the money comes from, but the story ends there.
It is a dead secret, though later on when I&#8217;m at liberty to open my heart
and tell you just what it all means, you&#8217;ll both agree with me that if the
kind lady is to get what she is aiming for, no one outside ought to know a thing
about her being interested in our trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course this sort of talk aroused the curiosity of the two boys to fever
pitch, but they did not attempt to &#8220;pump&#8221; Jack, knowing how useless
it would be; and at the same time realizing how unfair such a proceeding would
be toward their benefactress.</p>

<p>So they spent an hour and more in discussing the various means for making
their vacation in the woods a memorable one, long to be talked of as the
greatest event of the year. Long lists of needed supplies were made up, and
corrected, so that by the time Steve and Toby thought it time to start homeward,
they had managed to fairly map out their programme.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>&#8220;Fortunately
we can hire that splendid big khaki-colored waterproof tent belonging to
Whitlatch the photographer,&#8221; Jack said as the others were leaving,
&#8220;and all other necessities we&#8217;ll pick up at our various homes.
Goodnight, fellows, and mum is the word, remember.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>JACK AND HIS MATES IN CAMP</span></h2>

<p>It was rather late in the afternoon, some days later, when a light covered
wagon drawn by a stout though rather lazy horse, could have been seen moving
along the valley road among the famous Pontico Hills. Three boys dressed for
rough service in the woods sat upon the seat, with Jack doing the driving just
then, though both Toby and Steve had taken turns at this work during the long
day they had been on the road.</p>

<p>They were many miles away from Chester now, and pretty close to the end of
the journey, as Jack informed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll strike the old logging road just above here, you
see,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;and by following it a mile or so we are due to
come on the place where I&#8217;ve been told we&#8217;ll find a dandy camp-site,
with running water near by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky for us you managed to get hold of that old map, and copy it, I
tell you, Jack,&#8221; ventured Steve. &#8220;This is certainly a pretty wild
country up here, and with mighty few settlers around. I doubt if you could run
across a single farm in four square miles of territory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really worse than that, Steve,&#8221; admitted <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span> the other. &#8220;I think
you&#8217;d have to go three or four miles in any direction before you struck a
living soul; and then the chances are it&#8217;d only be some wandering
timber-cruiser, taking a look at the fine lumber prospects, with a hazy idea
that he might be able to strike a bargain with the party who owns all this land
up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they at one time started in to cut this timber,&#8221; said Toby,
glancing around at the myriad of lofty trees that stretched their tops toward
the sky, &#8220;they didn&#8217;t get very far before being called off, did
they, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe the land fell into other hands, and the new owner had no
desire to clean it of the timber. So operations stopped. But many an envious eye
has been turned in the direction of the Pontico Hills of recent years. They say
it carries the finest batch of uncleared land left in the county, if not the
whole State.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that grown-up road ahead of us, Jack,&#8221; called out
Toby, who had very keen eyesight; &#8220;do you reckon now that might be the
logging trail we&#8217;re looking for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what it is, my friend,&#8221; chuckled Jack; and upon reaching
the spot he forced the horse to make a turn to the right, though the animal
seemed a bit loath to obey the pull at the lines, apparently anticipating harder
work ahead.</p>

<p>They found it no easy task to push along the road over which the logging
teams had once made their way, so overgrown with vines and small saplings <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span> had it become. Steadily
they advanced, all of them eagerly observing the many interesting things that
caught their attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something moving back of that hanging vine,
fellows,&#8221; suddenly whispered Toby, hoarsely; &#8220;and I can&#8217;t tell
whether it&#8217;s a man or a sheep!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a doe and a spotted fawn, as sure as you live!&#8221;
ejaculated Steve just then, as two objects flashed off with graceful bounds that
carried them lightly over fallen trees and all other obstacles. &#8220;First
time I ever saw wild deer in their native haunts. We&#8217;ve got a gun along,
but of course nobody&#8217;d think of shooting deer out of season; and the law
especially protects those with young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve fetched that gun with us only as a sort of
protection,&#8221; said Jack, positively. &#8220;None of us would dream of
hunting in July. Fact is, I didn&#8217;t mean to carry it at all, but the lady
suggested that it might be just as well, since you never can tell what might
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby and Steve exchanged quick and suggestive glances at hearing Jack say
this. Somehow it struck them as meaning there might be a trace of danger in the
secret mission which Jack had undertaken for their mysterious benefactress. And
doubtless from time to time they would have further reasons for believing that
there was something deeper in their errand than merely taking photographs of the
wild country for the edification <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_12'></a>12</span> of the lady, who, for all they knew, might be the
owner of these miles and miles of wooded land.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun is getting pretty low down in the western sky, fellows,&#8221;
observed Toby, after a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I should say we&#8217;d come all of a mile since leaving that
valley road,&#8221; Steve added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m expecting to strike the place any old time now,&#8221; Jack
went on to tell them in a soothing tone. &#8220;Here and there you can see where
trees have been cut, though they grow so dense around here the slashes hardly
show. Keep a bright lookout for the bunch of oaks that makes a triangle, because
that&#8217;s where we pull up and make our camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two minutes afterwards and Toby gave an exultant cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see them, Jack, sure I do, and I tell you they&#8217;re beauties in
the bargain. A better landmark it&#8217;d be hard to find. Well, for one
I&#8217;m right glad our journey is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell that to Moses the nag, here,&#8221; laughed Jack, &#8220;because
he&#8217;d be mighty happy to know his work is through for a long spell.
We&#8217;ve fetched plenty of oats along, and mean to rope him out days, so he
can eat his fill of grass. Yes, that answers the description given on my map,
and we&#8217;ve finally arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and if you listen,&#8221; went on Steve, eagerly, &#8220;you can
hear a soft musical sound like water gurgling over a mossy bed. That must be the
little stream you told us was close by, and which <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span> would supply all our wants. Why,
I&#8217;m as thirsty as a fish out of water right now, boys; me for a
drink!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he hurled himself over the side of the wagon and went on a run in
the direction of the soft sweet murmur which he had rightly guessed could only
proceed from running water.</p>

<p>When a little later Steve, his raging thirst satisfied, joined his chums
again, he found Toby unharnessing Moses, while Jack was investigating the
immediate vicinity with an eye to locating the camp-site.</p>

<p>The wearied horse was led to water and then staked out with the long and
stout rope fetched along for this especial purpose. They anticipated having
little trouble with Moses while in camp, since all the beast would have to do
lay in the way of feeding, and being led to water twice a day.</p>

<p>Next the wagon was unloaded, and from the pile of stuff that soon littered
the ground, it was evident that the three lads had taken a fair advantage of
their expenses being guaranteed, for they certainly had not stinted themselves
along the &#8220;grub&#8221; line at least.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just got to rush things, and do our talking
afterwards,&#8221; suggested Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Toby, &#8220;because already the sun
is setting, and before long it&#8217;ll be getting plumb dark. Luckily enough we
thought to fetch that lantern along with us, though, and a supply of oil in the
bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8220;I
wonder,&#8221; said Jack, with an amused chuckle, &#8220;if there was a single
thing we did forget to pack in the wagon. Talk about going into the woods light,
when you&#8217;ve got a convenient wagon to carry things along, you&#8217;re apt
to fetch three times as much as you really need.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m one of those fellows who like comfort every time,&#8221;
admitted Steve; &#8220;and I suppose I&#8217;m responsible for a heap of these
things right now; but never mind, Jack, some of them may yet come in handy; you
never know.&#8221;</p>

<p>They seemed to be fairly well versed in the art of raising a tent; at least
Jack knew how to go about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time presses too much to be overly particular how we get it up
tonight,&#8221; he told the others when they suggested that it did not seem to
be quite as firmly staked as seemed proper. &#8220;Tomorrow we&#8217;ll rectify
all errors. Now, if Toby will begin to get the bedding inside, and sort over the
cooking things, I&#8217;ll make a fireplace. Steve, would you mind taking the ax
and cutting some wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy to do so,&#8221; chirped the big fellow, who had always boasted
of being handy with an ax, as his muscular condition gave him an advantage over
both the others. &#8220;The only trouble is I&#8217;m as hungry as a wolf right
now, and so much extra exercise will make me wild for my supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of the ax soon announced that Steve was doing his duty, and that a
supply of wood for the cooking fire was certain to be forthcoming.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>Meanwhile, Jack
had started to build a fireplace with a number of stones which lay conveniently
near by. From the blackened state of some of these the boy suspected they had
served for just such a purpose on some former occasion.</p>

<p>When he had fixed this to suit his ideas of the proper thing he had arranged
the stones so that one end of the fireplace was a little broader than the
other.</p>

<p>Across this space he now laid a metal framework that looked like a grill, and
which was two feet square. This was bound to prove a most valuable camping
asset, since coffee pot and frying pan could be placed on it without much danger
of those accidents that occur so often when they are balanced upon the rough
edges of the stones themselves.</p>

<p>All was now ready for the fire itself, which Jack quickly started. Toby gave
an exclamation of satisfaction the instant he saw the flames leap up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad we were in such a hurry,&#8221; he went on to say,
regretfully. &#8220;Some sort of ceremony ought to attend the starting of the
first fire in camp. It&#8217;s going to be our best friend you know, when even
we get ravenously hungry; and seems to me we might at least have joined hands,
and danced around the blaze while we crooned some sort of song dedicated to the
god of fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of those silly frills go in this camp, Toby, you want to
know,&#8221; said Steve, sternly, coming in just then with an armful of
firewood. &#8220;This is a business camp, and not a make-believe one.
We&#8217;re <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span> up here
to enjoy ourselves, and take pictures, but no barbaric rites can be allowed.
Leave all that for the savages of the South Sea Islands, or those fire
worshippers we read about. I love a fire as well as the next fellow, but you
don&#8217;t catch me capering around a blaze, and singing to it like a foolish
goose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby was too busily engaged then to attempt to argue the matter. He had
arranged most of the provisions so that a choice could be made, and now he ran
off a long string of edibles, most of which, however, would require too much
time in the cooking to be chosen.</p>

<p>As is usually the case under similar conditions, they finally decided to cut
off a couple of slices from the big ham, and with some of the already boiled
potatoes fried crisp and brown, make that the main dish for their first
supper.</p>

<p>Soon delicious odors began to arise and be wafted away on the evening air. If
any of those curious little woods rodents that might be peeping from their
covert at the invaders of their solitude had a nose capable of appreciating such
perfumes, they must have been greatly edified by these queer goings-on.</p>

<p>But hungry boys have no thought save to satisfy their clamorous appetites,
and so little unnecessary talking was done up to the time when the trio curled
themselves up with their feet under them, tailor fashion, and proceeded to clean
off their heaping pie pans of the savory mess that had been prepared.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FIRST NIGHT UNDER CANVAS</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;This is something that just can&#8217;t be beat!&#8221; Toby remarked,
after he had made serious inroads upon his first helping, and taken off the keen
edge of his clamorous appetite. &#8220;I enjoy my food at home all right, but
let me tell you nothing can ever quite come up to a supper cooked under the
trees, and far removed from all the things you&#8217;re accustomed to meeting
every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this coffee is sure nectar for the gods,&#8221; said Steve,
helping himself to a second cup as he spoke. &#8220;Now, at home I never can
bear this tinned cream, yet, strange to say, up here in the woods it seems to go
first rate. Pass me the sugar, please, Jack. And Toby, after I&#8217;ve slacked
my hunger a bit so I can act half way decent I&#8217;m meaning to toast some of
the slices of bread at that splendid red-ash fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they continued to sit there and fairly gorge themselves until Steve could
hardly sigh, he was so full; but then all boys are built pretty much alike in
that respect, so we can easily forgive Steve in particular. Cutting wood does
put an edge on a naturally keen appetite that knows no <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span> limit save capacity; and Steve had many
good qualities to more than balance his greediness.</p>

<p>Later on when they lay around enjoying the sight of the crackling fire, and
casting pleased glances toward the capacious khaki-colored waterproof tent that
stood close by, they talked of many things that had some connection with their
intended stay in the Pontico Hills country.</p>

<p>&#8220;This sweet little stream with the ice-cold water is the Spruce Creek
you&#8217;ve got marked on your map, of course, Jack?&#8221; suggested Toby.
&#8220;Now how far away would you say Paradise River lies from our
camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! not more than ten minutes&#8217; walk from here, I imagine, and in
that direction,&#8221; and Jack pointed as he spoke, showing that he already had
his bearings pretty well fixed in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you suppose those loggers ever made camp here when they
expected to get their timber out through the river, and the lake below, perhaps
shipping by way of Chester?&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby asked this question as though he sought information, and if so, he
appealed to the right person, for Jack was quick to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I understand that the ground lies pretty low down by the river,
Toby; and a camp there might be in danger of being flooded out with the spring
rise. You know Paradise River does get on a tear some years, and pours into our
lake like mad. These lumbermen had long heads, and didn&#8217;t mean to take
chances of being drowned out <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_19'></a>19</span> of their camp. This higher ground served them better,
just as it will us now. That&#8217;s the only answer I can think of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it comes mighty near being the true one, I&#8217;m telling you,
Toby,&#8221; affirmed Steve, positively. &#8220;I&#8217;m right glad we&#8217;ve
been wise enough to look out for that sort of thing. Huh! had one nasty
experience of being flooded in a camp, where we had to wade up to our necks in
the stream that grew in a night, for the little island was all under water. No
more of that sort of thing for this chicken, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked until all of them began to grow sleepy. Then the horse was looked
after for the last time, and found to be lying down, well satisfied with the
feed of oats and sweet grass that had made up his supper.</p>

<p>Inside the tent there was plenty of room, for the three intending sleepers.
Apparently Mr. Whitlatch, the photographer, carried quite a lot of paraphernalia
with him when going off on his periodical excursions, taking pictures of Nature
as found in the vicinity of Chester; and meant to have an abundance of room in
which to keep his camera and other traps safe from the heavy rainfalls that
frequently deluged that section of country.</p>

<p>Making themselves comfortable, the three boys tried to compose themselves for
the sleep they needed so much, for very likely none of them had rested soundly
on the last night under the family <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_20'></a>20</span> rooftree, on account of nervous anticipations of the
fun in store for them.</p>

<p>It turned out a difficult thing to do. Going to sleep away from the
surroundings with which they were familiar excited them so much that even though
they closed their eyes to shut out the fitful flashes of the fire burning just
outside they could not control their thoughts.</p>

<p>Then again at times sounds that were not at all familiar came to their ears.
As a rule they understood that these were made by the small fur-bearing animals
inhabiting the wooded region, and which must have been thrown into an unusual
state of excitement by their arrival on the scene.</p>

<p>The hours passed.</p>

<p>In due time all of the campers managed to get asleep, though, if they
awakened during the night, it must have given them a queer feeling to realize
that they were no longer surrounded by the familiar walls of their rooms at
home, but had only a thin canvas covering between themselves and the
star-studded heavens above.</p>

<p>Morning came.</p>

<p>The whinny of old Moses acted as reveille to arouse the trio inside the tent;
possibly the animal was accustomed to having his breakfast at peep of day, and
wanted to know why it was not forthcoming now.</p>

<p>First Toby, then Jack, and finally Steve came crawling forth, clad in their
warm pajamas. They stretched, and went through certain gymnastic <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span> feats calculated to limber
up their cramped muscles. Then, as the fresh morning air began to make Toby in
particular shiver, he plunged inside again to commence dressing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m so ferocious for my breakfast,
boys,&#8221; he hastened to explain, when the others followed him under the
shelter; &#8220;but that air is pretty nippy, seems to me, and I don&#8217;t
like too much of it when minus my clothes. Steve, how about you trying your hand
at those bully flapjacks you&#8217;ve been boasting of being able to make ever
since this camping trip was first planned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m game, if you both say the word,&#8221; affirmed the
other. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I just insisted on fetching that self-raising
pancake flour along. What would a camp be like without an occasional mess of
flapjacks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Later on, while Steve was making ready to carry out his job, Toby sought
Jack, who was doing something inside the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, do you know, Jack,&#8221; he went on to remark, &#8220;I woke up
some time in the night and couldn&#8217;t just make up my mind what it was
roused me. Seemed like a clap of distant thunder; but when I peeped out under
the canvas the stars were shining to beat the band. Did you happen to hear it
too, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I did, Toby,&#8221; returned the other, with a smile,
&#8220;and as you say, it did sound like far-away thunder. I saw you peeking
out, but <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
didn&#8217;t say anything, for old Steve was sleeping fine, and I didn&#8217;t
want to wake him up. After you went off again I crept outside for an
observation. It was around midnight then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course you could tell by the stars,&#8221; suggested Toby, eagerly.
&#8220;I saw you taking their positions about the time we crept in for a snooze.
I must learn how to tell the hour of the night by the heavens before we finish
this camping trip. It must be a great stunt, I should think, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As easy as falling off a log, once you begin to notice the heavenly
bodies, and their relations to each other,&#8221; Jack told him.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take pleasure in putting you on the right track any time you
see fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But about that sound, could it have been a blast of any sort,
Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s hard to say,&#8221; the other replied, looking
thoughtful, Toby saw. &#8220;It may be they are doing some quarrying miles away
from here; or else some railroad is being cut through the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But even if that&#8217;s so, Jack, why should any one want to set off
a blast in the middle of the night, tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give it up, Toby. Possibly before we leave this region we may have
found out an answer to your question. Forget that you heard anything queer,
that&#8217;s all. We expect to scour this whole region up here, and if anything
like that is going on, as likely as not we&#8217;ll learn all about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby looked strangely at his companion as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_23'></a>23</span> though a suspicion may have arisen in his mind to the
effect that perhaps this queer sound had something to do with the mission that
Jack had undertaken in coming to the Pontico Hill country; but Toby had the good
sense not to press the matter any further, though his boyish curiosity had
undoubtedly been exercised.</p>

<p>When breakfast was ready, they made themselves as comfortable as the
conditions allowed. Already there was a vast improvement over the arrangements
of the preceding night. Two short logs had been rolled up so as to serve as
seats while they discussed their meals. This was much nicer than squatting on
the ground in attitudes that severely tried the muscles of their bodies. Toby
promised to make a rude but serviceable camp table upon which their meals might
be served. And a host of other things were considered by means of which their
stay in the woods might be made much more comfortable.</p>

<p>They talked of numerous things besides those that concerned the present
outing. Football came in for a fair share of their attention, because the fever
to excel in sports had already seized hold of these Chester boys, and in the
fall they hoped to put a sturdy eleven in the field that would be a credit to
the town.</p>

<p>Besides this other sports were mentioned, especially those having an intimate
connection with the season of snow and ice. Lake Constance offered a fruitful
field for iceboating; and there <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_24'></a>24</span> could hardly be a finer stream than the crooked
Paradise River when it came to skating distances during a Saturday, or in the
Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>So the time passed. They had actually cleaned out the coffeepot and both
fryingpans of their contents, but at least no one could ever complain of getting
up hungry in that camp&#8211;not while Steve had anything to do with the
cooking. His flapjacks had turned out to be a big success, and Toby in
particular was loud in praise of them; though by the way he winked at Jack when
declaring them the best he had ever devoured, barring none, it was plainly
evident that he was saying this partly in the hopes that the gratified Steve
would repeat the dose frequently.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will never do,&#8221; said Jack, finally; &#8220;we have too much
on hand this morning to be loafing here. First we&#8217;ll get the dishes out of
the way, and then arrange programme for the work. By noon I expect to have
things more ship-shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others were eager to assist, and presently every one had his hands full.
The big tent was raised in better shape than could be done in their hurry of the
preceding evening. Then all their stock was gone over, some of it placed
securely away in the covered wagon until needed, and the rest kept handy for
immediate use.</p>

<p>A dozen different artifices were carried through, each intended to make
things more comfortable and handy. Plainly Jack knew ten times as much about the
business of camping-out as either of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_25'></a>25</span> his chums; and they were only too pleased to take
lessons from him, being eager to &#8220;learn all the frills,&#8221; as Toby
said.</p>

<p>And just as Jack had predicted when noon came they had most of these
innovations carried through, so that the afternoon could be used for other
enterprises as the humor suggested.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>TAKING A LOOK AROUND</span></h2>

<p>Toby had evidently been making up his mind about something, for they had
hardly finished a cold lunch when he turned to Jack and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a hunch there ought to be some mighty good fishing over
there in the river, do you know, Jack? I fetched my stuff along, and would like
ever so much to make a try there this afternoon, if either of you cared to go
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s too mean for anything,&#8221; grumbled Steve,
looking quite unhappy. &#8220;I&#8217;m just as fond of fishing as the next
fellow, and I&#8217;d like to take a whirl with the gamey bass of the upper
reaches of Paradise River; but hang the luck, I just oughtn&#8217;t to try to
walk that far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you, Steve?&#8221; demanded Jack; &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
heard you complain any, though come to think of it, you did limp more or less
when walking around this morning doing your share of the chores. Got a cramp in
your leg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but one of these shoes has rubbed my heel till it&#8217;s
sore,&#8221; fretted Steve, taking off his shoe to sympathetically rub that
portion of his pedal extremity. &#8220;If I expect to be able to toddle around,
and have any sort of fun while we&#8217;re up <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_27'></a>27</span> here I ought to keep quiet the balance of the day;
and also put some sort of lotion on my heel that&#8217;ll start it to
healing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go with you, Toby,&#8221; Jack went on to say,
&#8220;because I have planned to take advantage of this clear day to snap off a
few pictures, just to get my hand in, you see. My old camera wasn&#8217;t good
enough, the lady said, and so she had me step in and buy the finest in Chester.
It looks like a dandy box, and I aim to pick up a lot of mighty smart
photographs while we&#8217;re up in this neck of the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any objections then to my going off alone, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby asked this with such an appealing look on his face that Jack could not
find it in his heart to put any obstacle in the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t take a little tramp by
yourself if you feel that you just can&#8217;t wait until tomorrow, Toby,&#8221;
he told the other. &#8220;Only be careful not to get lost. I&#8217;ll loan you
my map, which you can study while waiting for a bite; and then again, you must
carry the compass along, too. I reckon you know something about telling the
points of the compass from the green moss or mould on the northwest side of
nearly every tree-trunk. Yes, go if you feel disposed, but start back an hour or
so before dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just when the fishing is bound to be at its best, too,&#8221;
complained Toby; &#8220;but then after I know the way, and have broken a regular
trail to and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span> from
the river, I can stay later. I dug a lot of worms in our garden, and picked up
some whopping big night-walkers besides, so I&#8217;m all fixed for bait, I
reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eagerly then Toby secured his jointed rod, and the little canvas bag in which
he kept all his paraphernalia, such as hooks, sinkers, extra lines and many
other things without which a fisherman&#8217;s outfit would not be complete.</p>

<p>Taking his quota of bait in an empty can that had contained some Boston baked
beans which the three lads had eaten cold for lunch, Toby started gaily forth,
whistling as he went.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said the river must lie directly west of here, Jack,&#8221; he
called back ere plunging into the woods; &#8220;so I&#8217;m heading that way
now. I expect to take notice of everything that looks at all queer, as I go
along, and make as broad a trail as I can, so I&#8217;ll have no trouble about
coming back the same way I go. Steve, wish me luck, because I know you just love
fried black bass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon Steve waved both hands after him as if in blessing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope you get a fairly good mess, Toby,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;not
more than we can manage at one sitting, because I hate a fish hog who wastes
twice as much as he can make use of. But if they do bite like sixty, say,
I&#8217;ll be sorry I didn&#8217;t make up my mind to limp along with you, no
matter how much this heel hurts.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Toby vanished. They could hear his merry <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_29'></a>29</span> whistle gradually growing more distant as he trudged
along, keeping his face set toward the west, and doubtless making sure of this
by frequent glances at the friendly compass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take a look at that heel of yours, Steve,&#8221; said Jack,
when they were thus left in charge of the camp. &#8220;Luckily I thought to
fetch some magic healing salve along, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll help you a
lot. We&#8217;ll fix that shoe, too, so it can&#8217;t do any more damage.
I&#8217;ve had a bruised heel myself, and I know how painful it always
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve was only too willing to have Jack&#8217;s assistance; and between them
the little operation was carried out. The limping camper declared his heel felt
ever so much better, and he believed he would have no further trouble from that
source, given a rest until the next morning.</p>

<p>Then Jack got out his new camera, and fussed around for half an hour or so,
examining its working before loading it with a roll of film. He appeared greatly
pleased with its excellent workmanship, and felt that if he only did his part
the results must be exceedingly satisfactory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be gone an hour, Steve,&#8221; he told the campkeeper, as he
prepared to make a start; &#8220;or, for that matter, don&#8217;t be surprised
if I&#8217;m away double that length of time. A whole lot depends on what I run
across interesting enough to make me take considerable pains to get a good
picture of it. I mean that our kind benefactress shall at least have the worth
of her money, and call it a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_30'></a>30</span> good investment, if a set of splendid pictures can
fill the bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, Jack, and I reckon it would be silly for me to tell you not
to get lost. You&#8217;ve been too long at the business to need any compass in
order to get around in a strange region. But if you should stray away, remember
to shout and I&#8217;ll fire the gun twice in answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain, Steve, and I won&#8217;t forget the
signal,&#8221; chuckled Jack. &#8220;If anybody should chance to drop in on you
while I&#8217;m gone, entertain them as your good sense tells you is the right
thing. But remember, we&#8217;re just up here for a vacation camping trip, and
nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I can be as close-mouthed as a clam, Jack, never fear!&#8221; sang
out Steve, as the other strode away the camera held over his shoulder by its
strap.</p>

<p>Jack was gone almost two hours. Then he once more showed up at the camp, and
Steve pretended to be greatly overjoyed at seeing him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking I had better get out the gun, and fire off both
barrels so&#8217;s to let you know where the tent lay,&#8221; he chuckled, as
though such an idea amused him considerably. &#8220;But I suppose you&#8217;ve
found some things worth snapping off; how about it, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I used up a six-exposure film, and believe I&#8217;ve picked up
some things well worth the trouble. Next time I&#8217;ll go in another
direction, and farther away from camp. This is a wonderful country, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span> Steve. I don&#8217;t
believe you could find grander bits of scenery than right here among the Pontico
Hills. Anything unusual happen since I went away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ve had a lot of visitors,&#8221; laughed the other boy,
&#8220;slick little chaps in their fur coats one and all. They are watching us
both right now, I reckon, behind the shelter of the leaves on the ground, and up
in some of these big trees. There were both red squirrels, and fat gray ones
that barked at me, and seemed to ask what business a chap walking on two feet
had in their domain. Then chipmunks galore live around here, and the little
striped fellows have already begun to get acquainted, for one ran in and picked
up a bit of bread I threw, and then whisked out of sight like fun over there
where he lives in the holes under the roots of that tree. Why, I&#8217;ve been
so employed watching them, and talking to them, that the time has just skipped
along. When I looked up at the sun just now and guessed you&#8217;d been gone
nearly two hours, I had to rub my eyes and figure it all out again. You see
I&#8217;m so used to telling time by clocks that it seems queer to use the sun
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No signs of Toby so far, I suppose, Steve?&#8221; asked Jack a little
later, as he emerged from the tent after putting his camera safely away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; announced the other. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;re
not worrying about him, Jack, and sorry already you let him go off alone. Mebbe
I ought to have kept him company, sore heel or not.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t
fret about it, Steve. Toby has common horse-sense, and could hardly get lost if
he tried his hardest. You see, the formation of the valley is calculated to
always set a fellow straight, even if he gets a little mixed in his bearings. It
runs directly southeast to northwest around here. Besides Toby has the compass,
and the sun is shining up there full tilt. He may not be in for another hour or
so; but I wouldn&#8217;t be alarmed even if the sun set with him still away. The
light of our campfire would serve as a guide to him, once darkness
fell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a fact, Jack. We could build a roaring blaze that
might be seen a mile and more away. I did hear one thing that surprised
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; demanded the other, looking expectant, as though
he could give a pretty good guess himself, which was as much as saying that he
had heard the same sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there must be some sort of mining going on not many miles away
from here,&#8221; argued Steve, &#8220;because that was surely a blast I heard
half an hour ago. First I had an idea it meant a coming storm, but there
wasn&#8217;t a sign of a cloud in sight. It seemed to be a deep, heavy
reverberation, just like I&#8217;ve heard dynamite make at the red-sandstone
quarry near Chester when the workmen at noon set off their blasts. Of course you
noticed it, too, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say so,&#8221; the other admitted, &#8220;and during
the night both Toby and myself were <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_33'></a>33</span> awakened by just the same sort of far-off dull
roaring sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must have been sound asleep then, because I never caught it,&#8221;
acknowledged the other, frankly; &#8220;but if you two boys talked it over, what
conclusion did you arrive at, may I ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were undecided,&#8221; said Jack, warily. &#8220;We sort of
inclined to the opinion that either a railroad was being cut through the hills
over to the north, or else there might be some sort of mining or quarrying being
carried on there. I told Toby that while it was an unknown quantity to us now,
the chances were in our scouting around while camping here for two weeks or
more, we stood to learn just what caused that queer booming sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Toby whistling, as sure as anything,&#8221; announced
Steve. &#8220;I figure from his merry tone that he&#8217;s met with a decent
bunch of luck. Yes, there he comes, swinging through the woods, and actually
following the trail he made in going out. Good boy, Toby, he&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s fish for supper in the bargain,&#8221; asserted Jack,
&#8220;for you can see he&#8217;s carrying quite a neat string of the finny
beauties. There, he holds it up so you can get your mouth ready for a
feast.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the fisherman came closer, Jack saw that he was looking a bit serious for
a fellow who had been so successful in his first fishing trip to the river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>&#8220;Something
happened, I calculate, eh, Toby?&#8221; demanded Steve, also reading the
signs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I&#8217;ve got a story to tell that <i>may</i> interest you
both,&#8221; admitted Toby with an important air.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>TOBY&#8217;S ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Now that&#8217;s what I get for staying home when I had a chance to go
along with you, Toby, old scout,&#8221; grumbled Steve. &#8220;Just my luck to
be left out of the running. Hang the sore heel, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over to the log and sit down, Toby,&#8221; tempted Jack;
&#8220;you must be a little tired after your long walk, and all the work of
catching such a bunch of fighters. It seems after all that the gamiest bass
frequent the upper reaches of Paradise River. And none of the fellows in Chester
cared to go that far when the fishing near home was always pretty
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Toby was escorted to the sitting log with one chum on either side. He
would not have been a natural boy if he did not feel his importance just then,
with two fellows eager to hear his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now pitch in and tell us what really did happen,&#8221; begged Steve;
&#8220;for of course by now you&#8217;ve got us all excited, and guessing a
dozen things in the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t have a bit of trouble finding the river,&#8221;
began Toby, just as though he felt he should conduct them gradually along until
the climax came, as good story-tellers do, he understood. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span> &#8220;All I had to do was to follow my
nose, and keep going ahead into the west.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon the Paradise River must lie about a mile and a half over
yonder; but in places the going isn&#8217;t as easy as you&#8217;d like.
Finally, I glimpsed running water, though to tell the truth I&#8217;d heard it
some time before; because in places there are quite some rapids, and they make
music right along, as the water gurgles down the incline, and swishes around
rocks that stick out above the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you, boys, the old river may look pretty fine in spots
down our way, but shucks! it can&#8217;t hold a candle to what you&#8217;ll see
up here. Soon&#8217;s I got my eyes fastened on that picture I thought of you,
Jack, and how you&#8217;d just love to knock off such a handsome view for
keeps.</p>

<p>&#8220;But fishing was what I&#8217;d come after, and so I put all other
notions out of my head. It didn&#8217;t take such an old fisherman as Toby
Hopkins long to settle on what looked like the most promising site for throwing
out in an eddy just below some frowning big rocks, and where the shadows looked
mighty inviting for a deep hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, the fun began right away. Hardly had my baited hook disappeared
in the dark water when I had a savage strike, and away my reel buzzed like fury.
He was a game fighter, let me tell you, and I had all I could do to land him,
what with his acrobatic jumps out of the water, and his boring deep down between
times. But everything <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_37'></a>37</span> held, and he chanced to be well hooked, so at last in
he came.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sure looked like business, and I lost no time in baiting up
again, for I knew how finicky bass are about biting, and that you have to make
hay while the sun shines, because they quit work just as suddenly as they start
in, without you understanding the cause either.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right away I had another, and then a third big chap followed which I
lost. But what did one fish matter when there seemed to be no end of them just
hanging around waiting a chance for grub&#8211;because that was just what I was
feeding &#8217;em, having fetched along two dozen big white and brown fat
fellows I got out of rotten stumps around home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before there was a lull, I had landed five of the string. Then they
quit biting, and I had a chance to rest up a bit, and do some thinking. So mebbe
half an hour passed, when suddenly something happened. I heard a cough, and
looked around right away, thinking that either Steve here, or you, Jack, had
taken a notion to follow my trail across to the river just to see what was going
on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I had a little shock just about that time. A man was standing
there not a great ways off, and watching me for keeps. He seemed to be scowling
like a black pirate, and something told me right away he didn&#8217;t much fancy
seeing me there, taking fish out of the river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>&#8220;I guess I
must have thought of half a dozen things all in a minute. He was one of those
slick wardens prowling around to see that the game laws were enforced; or it
might be he owned the land up here, and took me for a poacher who hadn&#8217;t
any right to be fishing on his preserves; then again, he looked so ugly and
black that I even figured whether he could be a desperate fugitive from justice
who&#8217;d been hiding in the Pontico Hills country, and hated to see anybody
coming in to bother him.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the tall man with the black mustache and goatee started to move
toward me I collected my wits and decided I&#8217;d have to seem cordial to him.
Then, Jack, I also remembered your warning not to peep a single word about our
having come up here for any other purpose besides having a jolly summer outing
during our vacation.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I nodded my head and said good morning to him just as cheerful and
unconcerned as I could. He grunted something, and kept coming along, watching me
like a hawk all the while, I could see. Why, I had a cold shiver chase up and
down my spine just like somebody had thrown a bucket of ice-water over me;
because all sorts of horrible things began to flash through my mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he chose to tumble me into the river and drown me, who&#8217;d ever
be the wiser for it, I thought; and perhaps I unconsciously moved back a bit
from the edge, as if I wanted to put on a fresh bait.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>&#8220;&#8216;Who may
you be, boy, and how does it happen that you&#8217;re fishing up here where not
a single soul have I seen in the weeks I&#8217;ve spent here?&#8217; was what he
said to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course I up and told him my name, and that I lived in Chester; also
how with two chums I was camping about a mile or more to the east.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the while I was speaking he kept those hawk-like black eyes of his
glued on my face. I felt my skin fairly burn, and wondered whether he could read
a fellow&#8217;s thoughts, which would surely give me away. But I told him the
truth, because we have come up here for our vacation camping, and mean to have a
bully good time of it fishing, walking, and eating until our grub runs low, and
we&#8217;ll have to head back to civilization.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I must have put up a pretty fair article of a yarn; leastways
he seemed just a mite more cordial when I&#8217;d got through; though I could
feel that his suspicions hadn&#8217;t all been set at rest, for he seemed mighty
uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me he was a surveyor employed by the owner of the property all
around there; but that owing to an accident to a companion, he had to
temporarily stop work, and was waiting for another assistant to arrive. But he
never once hinted at such a thing as our visiting him in his camp; or suggesting
that he&#8217;d like to drop in on us here during our stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;He asked a whole lot of questions about Chester folks and what was
going on down there; so <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_40'></a>40</span> thinking to interest him I told him about the new
spirit that had been aroused in Chester boys, and how we were going to have a
new gymnasium erected this coming fall; also how we licked Harmony at baseball,
and hoped to wipe their big eleven up on the gridiron when the football season
opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you believe it, that solemn-looking man never cracked a single
smile all the time I was giving him such a glowing description of sport events
down Chester way. And I want to go on record as saying that the man who has no
love for baseball or football in his system is fit for treason, stratagems and
spoils.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then finally he said goodbye, just as short as if he was biting it off
from a plug of tobacco, turned on his heel, and walked away as cool as you
please. Anyhow, I did make a face after him when I could see that his back was
turned. And, believe me, fellows, that man isn&#8217;t all right; he&#8217;s got
something crooked about his make-up as sure as two and two make four.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to say again I&#8217;m sorry I wasn&#8217;t along when you met
him, Toby,&#8221; he observed, disconsolately. &#8220;Not that I don&#8217;t
give you credit for being as smart as they make &#8217;em, but two heads are
better than one, even if one of them is a cabbage head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221; demanded Toby, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not committing myself,&#8221; grinned Steve. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span> &#8220;But all the same I
agree with you in saying that man must be crooked, though just what his game
could be up here I&#8217;m not able to even guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave Jack a quick, almost imploring look as he said this, as though
begging him to lift the veil and let them see a little light; but Jack only
turned to Toby and commenced to quiz him, asking numerous pointed questions, all
concerning the appearance of the dark-visaged stranger who had bobbed up so
unexpectedly to interrupt his sport with rod and reel.</p>

<p>It could be seen that Jack took especial pains to inquire into the personal
looks of the man. He even startled Toby once by asking suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you scrutinized his face as closely as you say you did, Toby,
perhaps you can tell me if he had a scar under his left eye, a sort of mark like
a small crescent moon, and which like most scars turns furiously red when any
excitement comes along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jack, I clean forgot to mention that!&#8221; Toby instantly
exclaimed. &#8220;He certainly did have just such a disfigurement, though I took
it for a birth-mark and not a scar or healed wound. So then you&#8217;ve already
got a good suspicion about his identity, have you? Well, this keeps on growing
more and more interesting. Steve and myself will be glad when the time comes for
you to open up and tell us the whole story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must hold your horses yet a while, fellows,&#8221; said Jack,
gravely. &#8220;The lady made me <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_42'></a>42</span> promise to keep the secret until I had gained the
information that was so important, and then I could tell you everything. Toby, I
want to congratulate you on playing your part well. That man had reason to
suspect you might be up in the Pontico Hills for something a heap more important
than just camping out. Perhaps he&#8217;s satisfied now you spoke the truth; and
then again he may still suspect something wrong, and want to keep an eye on us;
so we must never speak of these things except when our heads are close together.
At all other times we&#8217;ve got to act just like care-free lads off on a
camping trip would appear. There are other days to come, and bit by bit I reckon
the thing will grow, until in the end I&#8217;ve found out all I want to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing sure, Jack,&#8221; ventured Steve, meditatively,
&#8220;it&#8217;s no ordinary game this man with the black mustache and goatee
is playing up here in these hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can stretch a point,&#8221; Jack told him, with a twinkle in
his eye, &#8220;and agree with you there, Steve. It&#8217;s a <i>big</i> game,
with a fortune at stake; and so you can both understand how desperate that man
might become if he really began to believe that our being here threatened his
castles in the air with a tumble. So be on your guard all the time, boys, and
play your part. Suspense will make the wind-up all the more enjoyable; just as
in baseball when the score is tied in the ninth and Steve here has swatted the
ball for a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
three-bagger, with two men on bases, the pent-up enthusiasm breaks loose in a
regular hurricane of shouts and cheers, and we&#8217;re all feeling as happy as
clams at high tide. Now, let&#8217;s get busy on these fish, and have a regular
fry for dinner tonight!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>SIGNS OF MORE TROUBLE</span></h2>

<p>They had a most bountiful spread that evening. Steve and Toby insisted on
taking charge, and getting up the meal. Besides the fish, which by the way were
most delightfully browned in the pan, and proved a great hit with the three
boys, there was boiled rice, baked potatoes, warmed-up corned beef (from the
tin), and finally as dessert sliced peaches, the California variety; besides the
customary coffee, without which a meal in camp would seem decidedly poor.</p>

<p>All of them fairly &#8220;stuffed&#8221; after the manner of vigorous boys
with not a care in the wide world, and plenty more food where that came from.
After supper was over they had to lie around and take things easy for a while,
inventing all manner of excuses for so doing, when in reality not one of them
felt capable of moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say the bass up the river seem to taste a whole lot better than
down our way,&#8221; remarked Toby, reflectively. &#8220;Sometimes when
I&#8217;ve fetched a string home with me, and the cook prepared them for the
table they had what seemed like a muddy flavor. It may have been because the
river ran high just then, and this affected the fish more or less.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t
you believe it,&#8221; snapped Steve, philosophically. &#8220;The difference was
in the surroundings, and the kind of <i>appetite</i> you had. No matter if a
fellow does think he&#8217;s hungry at home, when he sits down to a white
tablecloth, and silver, and cut-glass, and all that sort of stuff it sort of
dulls the edge of his appetite. Then again he has to just wait his turn to be
served, and mustn&#8217;t forget his table manners if he knows what&#8217;s good
for him. But say, up in the woods he can just revert back to the habits of
primeval man from whose loins he sprang, and his appetite compares to that of
the wolf. Oh! things do taste altogether different, somehow or other; and meals
seem an <i>awful</i> long time apart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s on your mind, Toby?&#8221; asked Jack, a short time
afterwards, when he noticed the other looking pensive, as though his thoughts
might be busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I was only wondering whether we&#8217;d hear that queer old
booming sound again tonight, that&#8217;s all, Jack; and mebbe, too, I was
trying to figure out just how <i>he</i> manages to make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything comes to him who waits, Toby,&#8221; he said, simply;
&#8220;and so don&#8217;t worry yourself about things yet awhile. Let me
shoulder the burden; if it gets too heavy a load for one fellow to carry be sure
I&#8217;ll call on you two for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he deftly guided the conversation into other channels. There was plenty
to talk about, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> for
these were observing lads, who kept their eyes open no matter where they might
be; and every little while Toby would remember something he had noticed as he
made his way to or from the river, that he must describe in order to arouse
Jack&#8217;s interest, and cause him to decide on a trip across country
soon.</p>

<p>They sat up fairly late, for there was a peculiar fascination about the
crackling campfire that held them spellbound. They clasped their hands about
their knees, and stared into the glowing heart of the fire, as though capable of
seeing all manner of fantastic figures dancing there like madcap sprites. It was
the old, old story that never dies out, the spirit of devotion that mankind pays
to the element which he had compelled to serve him so well in a thousand
different ways, but principally to cook his food, and warm his chilled body.</p>

<p>Finally Toby admitted that his eyes were closing in spite of himself, and
Steve on hearing that frank confession commenced to yawn at a terrific rate; so
Jack said for one he meant to creep between his blankets and get some sleep.</p>

<p>All seemed well as they retired within the tent where, by the light of the
lantern, they could finish their disrobing, and don their warm flannel winter
pajamas, which, at Jack&#8217;s suggestion, they had fetched along with them,
because he knew how chilly the nights become in camp even during the &#8220;good
old summer-time.&#8221;</p>

<p>After all Toby had his fears for nothing, because <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span> he was not aroused by any mysterious
explosion. If anything of the sort happened he certainly failed to hear it, and
slept through the night.</p>

<p>When morning arrived they were on the job again, as Steve termed it; that is,
taking their waking-up exercises in front of the tent by doing a number of
gymnastic feats, and then after dressing proceeding with breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far we&#8217;ve been favored with good weather,&#8221; remarked
Steve, as they sat on the logs, and enjoyed the meal thus prepared. &#8220;Not a
drop of rain, and while fairly hot nothing unseasonable, to make us sizzle along
toward three in the afternoon. But seems to me there&#8217;s a change due before
long. I don&#8217;t quite like the looks of the sun this morning; and it came up
glowing red in the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it did, Steve,&#8221; assented Toby, &#8220;and they say
that&#8217;s a good sign of stormy weather. Well, all we can do is take things
as they come, the bad with the good. When fellows camp out for two weeks they
ought to go prepared for wet as well as dry weather. I&#8217;ve fetched along my
rain-coat, and the rubber cap that keeps your neck dry in the toughest of a
downpour; and rubber boots, so why should I worry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;re prepared to be a regular waterdog, Toby,&#8221;
said Steve, &#8220;we&#8217;ll look to you to do all the stray jobs when it
rains. Jack and myself not being so well prepared can stick to the tent and keep
dry.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8220;Perhaps
you&#8217;re counting your chickens before they&#8217;re hatched,&#8221;
chuckled Jack, apparently much amused by this conversation on the part of his
chums; &#8220;for there&#8217;s no certainty that it means to rain today. That
sign business used to make a great hit with people before they began to reason
things out; but it as often misses making connections as it does strike the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess it must be a whole lot like the almanac people,&#8221; laughed
Toby. &#8220;You know they just guess at probabilities when setting down what
the weather is going to be six months ahead. I remember reading a story about
one of the most famous of almanac makers, I forget what his name was, but let it
go as Spilkins. He was walking out in the country one fine morning when there
wasn&#8217;t a sign of a cloud in the sky. A farmer working in a field called
out to him that he&#8217;d better keep an eye above, for like as not
there&#8217;d be rain before the day was done. Spilkins only laughed at him, and
went on; but sure enough, an hour later it clouded over like fun, and down came
the rain, so that he had to seek shelter in a friendly barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, as an almanac man, he thought it worth while to go back and
interview that hayseed, and find out just how he could tell there was rain
coming when not a sign was visible. I guess Spilkins thought he might pick up a
valuable pointer that he could make use of in prognosticating the weather
ahead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>&#8220;The man was
working again in his field, where the shower had made things look fresh and
green. So Mr. Spilkins called him over to the fence, and after passing a few
pleasant remarks, bluntly asked him how he could scent rain when not a small
cloud was in the sky. The farmer grinned, and this is what he told him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, you see, Mister, we all of us take Spilkins&#8217; Reliable
Family Almanac around this region, and we goes by it regular like. When he sez
it&#8217;s going to rain we calculate we&#8217;ll have a fine day for haying;
and when he speaks of fair weather, why we just naturally git out our
rain-coats, and lay for having a spell in the woodshed. And I happened to notice
this same mornin&#8217; that he predicted a fine day, so I jest knowed
it&#8217;d sartin sure rain; and, sir, <i>it did</i>!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Both the others laughed at the story, which neither of them had heard before,
old though it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just about the haphazard way almanacs are built
up,&#8221; observed Jack. &#8220;Of course in a few instances they do hit the
truth; so could any of us if we laid out a programme for a year ahead.
It&#8217;s natural to expect hot weather along about this time of the summer;
and such a spell is always followed by a cooler period. So we&#8217;ll take our
ducking when it comes, and not bother our heads too much ahead of that
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>While sitting there they mapped out their intended plans for the day. Jack
figured on starting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
out a little later, and securing some more photographs. Steve, not wanting to
spend another day in camp, asked permission to accompany him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly you can come along, Steve,&#8221; he was told; &#8220;if you
think your heel is equal to the long jaunt, because I may cover quite a good
many miles before coming back to camp again. How about that? I wouldn&#8217;t
like you to start limping, and be in misery for hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! the old thing seems to be all right this morning, Jack,&#8221;
Steve assured him. &#8220;That salve was sure a magic one, let me tell you, and
took all the pain out of the rubbed place. I&#8217;ve found a way to prevent it
ever hurting again; and right now I&#8217;d be equal to a twenty-mile tramp if
necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Toby, will you mind acting as camp guardian for today?
Tomorrow one of us might want to go over to the river with you, and have a try
at the bass; but on the whole, I think it would be wise to keep watch over our
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack said this seriously, so they knew he was not joking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, do you really think that man, or any one else, for that matter,
would actually <i>steal</i> things from us?&#8221; demanded Steve, frowning as
he spoke, and perhaps unconsciously clenching his fists pugnaciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only guessing, remember,&#8221; Jack informed him. &#8220;It
might be a raid on our camp would be <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_51'></a>51</span> made during our absence. Don&#8217;t you see, if our
being up here annoyed certain people, the quickest way they could get rid of us
would be to steal all our eatables while we were away from camp. We
couldn&#8217;t stick it out and go hungry, could we? Well, on that account then
we&#8217;d better keep a watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; snapped Toby, while Steve looked even
more aroused than ever at the bare possibility of such a calamity overtaking
them; for Steve, as we happen to know, was a good eater, and nothing could
appall him more than the prospect of all those splendid things they had brought
along with them being mysteriously carried off by unknown vandals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toby, just you keep that shotgun handy, and defend our grub with the
last drop of blood in your veins,&#8221; he went on to say. &#8220;Now,
I&#8217;ll step out and see if Moses has finished the oats I gave him before we
had our breakfast. While about it I&#8217;ll lead him over for a drink at Turtle
Creek below the spot where we get our supply of clear water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for your trouble, Steve; you&#8217;ll save me doing it
later,&#8221; spoke up Toby, graciously. &#8220;When you fellows are off
I&#8217;ll wrestle with the dishes and cooking outfit. After that I&#8217;ve got
several things I want to fix about my fishing tackle&#8211;some snells to tie
fresh after heating them in boiling water; and hooks that need filing about the
points, as they seem a bit dull. Then there&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span> a guide on my pole&#8211;I mean my rod,
that needs winding with red silk thread. Oh! I&#8217;ll find plenty to keep me
busy I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterward Steve came hurrying back with a look of concern on his
face that caused both Jack and Toby to jump to the conclusion that he had made
some sort of important discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t Moses that&#8217;s broken away and given us the slip, I
hope?&#8221; gasped Toby, and then adding: &#8220;no, because I see him over
there where we tied him out so he could eat his fill of green grass.
What&#8217;s happened, Steve; you look like you&#8217;ve met up with a
ghost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a visitor last night, just as sure as anything, boys,&#8221;
said Steve, solemnly; &#8220;and we can thank our lucky stars he didn&#8217;t
run off with our stuff in the bargain!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>PROSPECTING FOR PICTURES</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that, Steve?&#8221; asked the startled Toby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I can read tracks when I see them!&#8221; snapped the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve come across some sort of trail, I reckon?&#8221;
ventured Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I have,&#8221; came the quick reply, &#8220;and here&#8217;s
the way I happened to hit on it. Tell me, do either of you chance to own this
pocket handkerchief?&#8221; and as he spoke Steve flipped the article in
question from its hiding place, and held it up before his comrades.</p>

<p>Both gave a hasty look, and shook their heads in the negative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never saw it before,&#8221; Toby went on record as saying; &#8220;and
it&#8217;s an unusually fine piece of material, I should say, just such as a
gentleman who cared a heap for his personal appearance and clothes would be
likely to carry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you picked that up first of all, and it excited your suspicions;
is that it, Steve?&#8221; queried Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;It started me to looking around the spot,&#8221; explained the other,
&#8220;and right away I saw the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_54'></a>54</span> tracks of shoes&#8211;long shoes in the bargain,
making prints entirely different from anything we&#8217;d be likely to do. So
says I to myself, &#8216;hello, Mister Man! I see you&#8217;ve been snooping around
here while we slept like the babes in the woods!&#8217; And so I came in to let
you fellows know about it. Want to see for yourselves, don&#8217;t you? Then
just follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were soon examining the imprints. Just as Steve had said, there could be
no question as to the tracks having been made by some one other than themselves.
More than this, Jack could easily tell that they were comparatively fresh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s follow them a little bit, and see what he was up
to,&#8221; he suggested, which they accordingly set out to do, and found that
while the stranger did not actually enter the camp he did scout around it as
though desirous of seeing all he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wanted to know if Toby here spoke the truth when he said we were only
a bunch of fun-loving boys off on a vacation camping trip, didn&#8217;t he,
Jack?&#8221; Steve asked, as if to confirm his own suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he actually went completely around our camp, and in several
places seems to have approached pretty close,&#8221; Jack went on to say, after
they had given up following the trail of the unknown man. &#8220;I think he must
have even heard some of us breathing inside the tent, and perhaps he could count
our number that way. But after all no great harm has been done; only it goes to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span> show we must keep
our eyes open all the time we&#8217;re up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby heaved a great sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! but it&#8217;s getting some exciting, let me tell you, fellows.
All the while you&#8217;re gone today I&#8217;ll be nervous and think I heard
footsteps every time a gray squirrel whisks around a tree, or barks at me so
sassy like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think this could be the same man who talked with Toby
yesterday, Jack?&#8221; Steve inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can guess that it must have been,&#8221; came the answer. &#8220;He
wasn&#8217;t wholly satisfied with things, and dropped over in the night to
learn if this camp was actually run by boys. You see how wise the lady was,
after all, for if this party had run upon three <i>men</i> in camp up here, the
chances are he&#8217;d be more apt to suspect their motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve shook his head as though ready to give it up. He never in all his life
had been so thoroughly mystified as just then. Toby, too, had an anxious
expression on his face, as though he would give considerable if only Jack felt
disposed to explain the whole matter. But Jack held his peace; apparently
nothing could induce him to betray the confidence of the lady who had trusted
him. When the right time arrived, he would divulge the secret; but until then
both his chums must content themselves with taking it out in speculations.</p>

<p>Finally, Jack began to collect his photographic <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span> paraphernalia as though about to get
ready to start forth on his tramp. Steve had meanwhile looked after a
&#8220;light lunch,&#8221; which he facetiously called a &#8220;snack&#8221;;
though it filled two of his coat pockets, and Jack had some difficulty in
stowing away his portion.</p>

<p>Toby eyed these amazing preparations with something akin to awe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, do you really expect to come back tonight, or are you figuring on
staying out a whole week?&#8221; he asked plaintively; at which Jack, taking
compassion on him, hastened to assure Toby there was no cause for worry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Steve&#8217;s weakness,&#8221; he went on to say aside,
&#8220;and of course he is always in deadly fear of starving to death.
That&#8217;s why he loads himself down so with grub on the least provocation.
But never expect to see a crumb come back, for that would be against
Steve&#8217;s principles, you know. He thinks it a shame to waste food; and so
he&#8217;d stuff himself until he could hardly breathe rather than throw
anything away. We may be a little late in the afternoon, but we&#8217;ll bob up
serenely long before dark comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they set out, Toby waving them goodbye with his dish towel, for he had
started in to do the breakfast things.</p>

<p>For a whole they walked along, observing everything that seemed worth their
attention. Then Steve took note of a certain fact which he deemed significant.
This was that Jack was heading in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_57'></a>57</span> an almost straight line, as though he had arranged a
plan of campaign for that day; and also that if they kept along that course,
sooner or later they were bound to fetch up in the neighborhood of the place
where that strange booming sound had originated.</p>

<p>This fact agitated Steve, and made him think many things. He even found
himself speculating upon the chances of their running across the stranger who
was taking such a deep interest in their presence in the Pontico Hills
country.</p>

<p>Jack did not make any pretense at hurrying. He was taking his time, it
seemed, and enjoying the scenery around him. A thousand things called for
exclamation of delight, for the woods looked especially grand with the sun
glinting on the green foliage of the various trees, some of which were veritable
forest monarchs.</p>

<p>Once before noon arrived, Jack stopped short. The largest tree thus far
encountered confronted them. Just what size butt it had I should be afraid to
say, for fear I might not be believed, but it was perfectly enormous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must try to get a shot at that dandy oak,&#8221; said Jack, with
bubbling enthusiasm, such as becomes an amateur photographer who loves his
calling. &#8220;Never have I set eyes on such a majestic king of the woods.
I&#8217;m sure it will make a splendid picture with you standing alongside,
Steve, just to show its enormous girth. The pity of it is that I can&#8217;t
dream of trying to get the whole tree <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_58'></a>58</span> in the picture, for no camera could do that in these
dense woods, where you can&#8217;t get far away from the object you&#8217;re
photographing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found that the side toward the sun was after all the best for his purpose,
and accordingly, after a little maneuvering, Jack secured a picture of the
tremendous monarch of the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess now he was a pretty hefty old tree when Columbus discovered
America,&#8221; said Steve, afterwards, as he tried to measure the butt by
passing around it many times with his arms fully extended. &#8220;Just think of
all the stirring events in history that this giant has outlived. It makes a
fellow look up with respect, and feel as if he wanted to take off his cap to the
patriarch, doesn&#8217;t it, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give him the right name when you say that, for a fact, Steve;
because there&#8217;s no way of our telling just how many hundred years he has
stood right in this same spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not a tree,&#8221; grinned Steve,
&#8220;because it must be terribly monotonous staying all your life rooted to
the ground, and never seeing anything of this beautiful world. As for me, I want
to travel when I grow up, and look on every foreign land. Going on now, Jack,
are you? Soon be time to take a little noon rest, and lighten the loads
we&#8217;re carrying in our pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Given half an hour more and it&#8217;ll be noon,&#8221; Jack informed
him, after taking a look aloft to where the beaming sun was high in the heavens.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span> &#8220;I never like
to eat lunch until then, so let&#8217;s wait a bit. Besides, I&#8217;m not quite
as hungry as I ought to be to do justice to all that stuff you put in my
pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that Jack did not seem anxious to snap off further pictures, though
they came across a number that would have made excellent ones. Steve wondered
whether he might not be saving his film for something more important. Even the
thought gave a delicious little thrill, his imagination was so highly excited by
now.</p>

<p>Then came the time when Jack, taking another look aloft, announced that the
sun had reached his zenith, or nearest point overhead. That was good news for
Steve, although truth to tell he had for some time been slily nibbling at the
contents of one of the packages he carried in his pockets, unable to resist the
temptation while the opportunity was within his grasp.</p>

<p>Fortune favored them again; but then possibly the presence of that sweet
singing little rivulet that meandered through the forest may have had something
to do with Jack&#8217;s decision to stop for lunch; he was always seeing these
small but very important things, as Steve very well knew.</p>

<p>They found a mossy bank and sat down, Steve with a great sigh of contentment;
but whether this was caused by the fact that his lame foot was hurting him a bit
again, or just from plain delight over the arrival of &#8220;feeding
time,&#8221; it would be hard to say; nor, indeed, fair to big Steve, who <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span> might have his weaknesses,
but on the whole was a real good fellow.</p>

<p>Here the pair sat and ate and drank of the cold water until they had fully
satisfied the inner man. After all, Steve was compelled to wrap up part of his
lunch again, being utterly unable to devour it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! guess that time my eyes were bigger &#8217;n my stomach,&#8221; he
grunted, being too full for much speaking; &#8220;but, then, never mind, we are
quite a ways from camp, and I often take a little bite around three in the
afternoon, even when I&#8217;m home. So it isn&#8217;t going to be wasted,
believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only waisted,&#8221; laughingly said Jack, and then apologized for
getting off such an atrocious pun.</p>

<p>They decided to lie around for an hour, and then push on a little farther
before turning back. That Jack figured would bring them to the camp by the
triangle oaks an hour or so before darkness came on, which was time enough.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant for Steve, lying there on his back, and feeling the
gentle breeze fan his heated face; for around about noon the sun&#8217;s rays
began to grow pretty fervid, and Steve often mopped his perspiring and beaming
face, though taking it good naturedly.</p>

<p>Both of them shut their eyes and rested, though not meaning to even take what
Steve was pleased to call a &#8220;cat nap.&#8221; It was peculiarly still just
at that hour after the middle of the day. The little woods animals must all be
sleeping in their burrows, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_61'></a>61</span> or the hollow trees where they had their nests. Even
the inquisitive squirrels were only noticeable by their absence. A scolding bevy
of crows alighted in a tree some distance off, and kept up what Steve called
facetiously a &#8220;crow caucus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The time Jack meant to remain there resting, had almost expired when both of
the boys suddenly sat up, and held their heads in a listening attitude.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WHEN THE CAT RULED THE ROOST</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard foxes bark before, Jack,&#8221; said Steve, with a
trace of excitement in his manner, &#8220;but never like that. I reckon now
those bowwows were plain dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; remarked his companion, nodding his head at the
same time, while a pleased look flashed athwart his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t so far away, either, was it?&#8221; continued Steve,
meditatively. &#8220;We have the air in our favor, that&#8217;s true, but the
sound was pretty strong. Huh! seems as if we may not be the only campers in this
stretch of the Pontico Hills. Other folks have taken a notion to come up here. I
wonder if they can be Chester fellows, or from some other place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter much to us who they are, since we don&#8217;t
intend to mix with them,&#8221; said Jack, drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a pretty husky bark, Jack, and I should say on a venture the
beast might be a fair-sized dog. I think I&#8217;ll look around for a nice club
as we saunter along. Never did fancy being jumped on by a mastiff, or a vicious
collie. Been bitten twice already, and the third time might be fatal to poor
little Stephen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>&#8220;That
isn&#8217;t a bad idea,&#8221; his mate told him; &#8220;and I&#8217;ll copy
your example. Then if we are unlucky enough to run smack into the beast, we can
keep him at bay anyhow until his owners come up and rescue us. But I&#8217;d a
heap rather not have it happen. As you say, the air is coming toward us, which
is a good thing; for in that case even a dog with a good nose wouldn&#8217;t be
apt to get our scent in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack now evinced a disposition to move on. It was as if that series of gruff
barks from the unseen dog had acted as a sort of challenge; and having a duty to
perform he meant to carry it out grimly.</p>

<p>They accordingly walked on, not making any kind of haste. Indeed, Jack showed
a disposition to act cautiously. He was continually keeping a careful vigil,
and, as a rule, his eyes were directed ahead. There seemed to be no longer a
disposition to look for beautiful vistas that might draw forth exclamations of
delight; and as for snapping off a picture, why, Jack had slung his camera back
of his shoulder with a final air that told he had put such an idea completely
out of his head.</p>

<p>As the minutes passed and they heard no further indications of the
dog&#8217;s presence near by, they concluded that he must have gone back to his
day dreams. Steve found himself more than ever puzzled by the actions of his
companion. He wished harder than before that Jack would lift the veil a little,
and tell him what it all meant, who <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_64'></a>64</span> that man might be, and what he was doing up there
among the hills that would bear watching.</p>

<p>It began to get real exciting once, when Jack suddenly ducked and pulled
Steve down with him, as though he had glimpsed something suspicious. Valiant
Steve gripped his club with a firmer clutch, took a big breath, and awaited the
coming of the savage dog; for he believed nothing less than this was about to
confront them.</p>

<p>Jack raised his head so that he might see above the bushes behind which they
chanced to be crouching. Then he gave a low chuckle as of amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;False alarm after all, Steve!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;See, it was
only a red fox scuttling away, with his big brush dangling behind him. He was
just waking up after his afternoon nap, and wondering where he could get a fat
partridge for his supper when our coming disturbed him. I just caught a glimpse
of something moving, and on the spur of the moment of course could think only of
the dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve breathed freely again. He also knocked on the ground a bit savagely
with that elegant club of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m just as well pleased, Jack,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;though I had it made up to give the brute all that was coming to him.
Once let me get a fair crack at him with this stick, and he&#8217;ll go daffy, I
warrant you. I&#8217;ll put all the vim into the blow that stands for a home-run
hit on the diamond. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
But remember, I don&#8217;t like dog, and I&#8217;m not aching for a chance to
make the try.&#8221;</p>

<p>So again they started along, still heading straight toward the region out of
which had come that tell-tale barking. They had come to a still wilder section
of country by now. The land was cut up by little ridges and gullies and walking
proved more tiresome. Jack appeared to notice this fact, as though it might have
a certain significance in his eyes. To Steve, however, it only meant that there
must be more chances of game holding forth amidst these dark and gloomy
depressions, where trees and heavy undergrowth combined to make an almost
impassable stretch.</p>

<p>While there was really no trail for them to follow, it happened that the
easiest way to make progress took them along a direct line. On either hand the
impediments seemed to be such as to discourage any variation from their course.
Only with considerable effort could they have pushed through the tangled
vegetation, and for one, Jack did not seem disposed to try it.</p>

<p>Then something happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! did you hear that, Jack?&#8221; gasped Steve.</p>

<p>Both of them had come to an abrupt halt, and were standing there, straining
their eyes to see what lay ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first time it was a dog,&#8221; muttered Jack, as if communing
with himself; &#8220;and now, unless I&#8217;m might mistaken, that meant
cat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cat!&#8221; echoed Steve, incredulously. &#8220;Why, it <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span> was a whole lot louder
noise than any cat I ever ran across could make! a snarl that sent a cold chill
racing up and down my backbone. Cat? What sort of a cat would you call it,
Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wild cat, if anything,&#8221; replied the other, neither of them
stirring as yet. &#8220;Look around you and tell me if anybody could imagine a
better place for such a beast to live in. And I think I&#8217;ve located it. We
can find out quickly enough by making a move as if to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suited the action to the words. Instantly there came the repetition of
that vicious snarl. It seemed to contain all the concentrated essence of savage
hatred, and sent another shiver over Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I can see the critter, Jack!&#8221; snapped Steve, extending his
club to point toward a certain tree standing directly in their path.
&#8220;Crouching right on that lower limb. Oh! how his yellow eyes glare at us!
Excuse me from wanting to come to close quarters with such a demon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For one thing, you&#8217;ve settled on the wrong gender, Steve,&#8221;
remarked Jack in a fairly cool tone; &#8220;because if you look sharper
you&#8217;ll see two other puffy balls close by the first one. Those are
half-grown whelps, and the mother stands ready to defend them to the last ounce
of her strength, and drop of blood. We&#8217;ve surprised Mrs. Cat at
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right there, Jack, those must be cubs, for I saw one
move just then. But with such a combination against us what are we going <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span> to do? Surely you
won&#8217;t think of trying to scare the old cat away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty armed men couldn&#8217;t do that, so long as her kits were in
danger,&#8221; Jack told him. &#8220;If we still mean to advance there&#8217;s
only one way to do it. We can&#8217;t fly over, and consequently it&#8217;s up
to us to go around, or else turn back and acknowledge ourselves
baffled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to do that last the worst thing,&#8221; grumbled Steve, giving
another whack at the ground with his long club, shaped somewhat like a baseball
bat; &#8220;but whatever you say goes, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks a trifle easier traveling over on the left,&#8221; observed
Jack, &#8220;so let&#8217;s make our try there.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they started, there was another volley of snarls from the beast in the
tree, evidently laboring under the impression that this flank movement had some
bearing on the safety of her precious offspring.</p>

<p>Steve kept his eyes turned in that quarter about as much as he used them to
take notice of the way he was going. Every unusually loud snarl made him think
the cat was about to launch herself toward them in an attack; so that the boy
was kept worked up to fever heat all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on the move, Jack!&#8221; he now hissed. &#8220;I saw her
leap down to the ground and run along. Say, she&#8217;s keeping on a line with
us, would you believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack took a look himself in order to be convinced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_68'></a>68</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there, Steve,&#8221; he
said, with a short laugh. &#8220;After all our trying this little dodge may not
be worth the candle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s bent on keeping us from advancing, seems like,&#8221;
complained Steve. &#8220;Why, the pesky thing acts like she had a mortgage on
all that stretch of woods beyond here, and didn&#8217;t mean to let us foreclose
on her either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing sure, she isn&#8217;t afraid of two fellows like us,&#8221;
chuckled Jack. &#8220;Even our clubs have no terror for the mother of the
kitties. Why, if we dared push on ahead she&#8217;d jump at us like a
flash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly feel cheap, being held up like this by an ordinary
cat,&#8221; gritted the burly Steve between his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re up against an enraged wildcat mother,&#8221; Jack
told him, &#8220;and without a sign of a gun to back you, that&#8217;s the time
to spell prudence in big capital letters. They&#8217;ve got terrible claws, and
can use them to tear a fellow&#8217;s clothes to ribbons, not to mention what
they&#8217;ll do to your hide. No use talking, Steve, if the miserable beast is
dead set on keeping us from going on we&#8217;ll have to own up beaten, and
retire with our skins whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost track of her for a minute, Jack. Wonder now if
she&#8217;s gone back to her family, thinking we&#8217;ve been scared
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can test that easy enough,&#8221; he was informed; &#8220;just
take a step or two forward, and see what happens; but don&#8217;t be too rash,
Steve. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span> You&#8217;ll
need all your good looks when you get back to Chester again. I&#8217;d hate to
see the map of Ireland across your face in red scratches. Besides, there&#8217;s
always danger of blood poisoning setting in when a wild animal has scratched
you, especially one that is carnivorous by nature. Go slow now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The experiment met with an immediate success, for there broke forth a fresh
series of explosive snarls even more ferocious than any that had gone before.
Steve drew up in a hurry, evidently under the impression that he was in danger
of being made the object of an attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s there still, Jack!&#8221; he exclaimed, just as
though there could be any doubt of such a thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw her move, in the bargain,&#8221; his companion went on to say.
&#8220;She has kept on a line with us all the while, and still bars the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is simply disgusting,&#8221; fretted Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that can&#8217;t very well be helped,&#8221; Jack
told him: &#8220;and so what&#8217;s the use of feeling bad about it. There are
other days coming, when we may be able to pass along here without being balked
by a mother cat with kittens. You know the old saying, &#8216;what can&#8217;t be
cured must be endured,&#8217; so we&#8217;ll have to make the best of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that mean we&#8217;re at the end of our rope for today,
Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems that way, Steve; the cat rules the roost this time,
apparently.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>BACK TO THE WOODS CAMP</span></h2>

<p>Steve had a fairly well developed stubborn streak in his nature, and he
certainly did hate to give a thing up, once he had got started. Worst of all was
the fact of their being compelled to acknowledge defeat through a miserable
wildcat; had it been a panther now, a tiger, or a lion, he might bow to the
inevitable with a good grace; but cats, in his mind, were always to be
associated with the night-singing Tommies at home, for which species he felt a
contempt that could best be displayed by a rock thrown from a bedroom
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! I hate to do it, but just as you say, Jack, the beast is set
on drawing a regular dead line ahead of us, which we can&#8217;t pass without a
fight. So when you&#8217;re ready give the word and we&#8217;ll quit cold.
I&#8217;ll never feel like telling any of the fellows at home, though, how two
of us were forced to turn tail by just one measly cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might sit down here for a spell, and see if the brute will slink
away,&#8221; suggested Jack, evidently also averse to giving up so easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; agreed Steve; and accordingly they found a
convenient log upon which they could rest while waiting to see how the plan
worked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>Time passed, and
Steve kept his face turned toward the spot where the last savage snarl had been
heard. He had a vague suspicion that perhaps the beast might try to stalk them,
just as he had seen a domestic tabby do a sparrow at home.</p>

<p>When fully ten minutes had crept by Jack made a slight move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t hang out here much longer,&#8221; he was saying;
&#8220;already the afternoon is so far along that I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll
never be able to get back to camp before dark sets in. Let&#8217;s make a move,
and test things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had they done so than once again they heard a repetition of those
warning growls. Jack shrugged his shoulders and laughed drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hear you, old lady with the claws!&#8221; he called out, &#8220;and
we understand that you are still on the job. It looks like she didn&#8217;t mean
to lose sight of two such suspicious appearing chaps as we seem to be. Well, our
cake is dough, and we might as well acknowledge ourselves beaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! why didn&#8217;t we fetch our gun along, Jack?&#8221; sighed
Steve, looking angrily toward the spot from whence the warning snarls had
volleyed at them. &#8220;I&#8217;d give every cent in my savings bank for the
chance to knock that critter over. What use are pesky wildcats anyway? They live
on game birds and rabbits most always. If I had my way I&#8217;d clean out the
whole bunch of them, kits as well as mother cats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t do anything along that line this <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span> trip,&#8221; Jack told
him. &#8220;So say what you&#8217;ve got on your mind to the lady, and
let&#8217;s clear out. These woods belong to her this afternoon, and we&#8217;ve
got no business here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to waste any more of my precious breath on the
silly beast,&#8221; grumbled Steve, as he turned his back toward the spot where
the unseen enemy lay concealed in the scrub.</p>

<p>Jack headed toward the open space along which they had formerly been walking.
He had been wise enough to keep this in mind when trying to circumvent the
obstinate feline enemy that refused to let them pass. Once they found their
trail, and it would be an easy matter to follow it toward camp.</p>

<p>They had lingered longer than either of them seemed aware. This fact was
presently brought to their attention by the growing gloom of the woods around
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Jack, the sun has gone down, I do believe!&#8221; exclaimed
Steve, suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t time for it to set yet,&#8221; his chum advised
him. &#8220;We can&#8217;t make sure of it, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if
a bank of heavy clouds has risen in the west, and hidden the sun behind it. One
thing certain, we&#8217;re going to have the fun of tramping several miles
through a dark woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so long as there are no rattlesnakes around this section of
country, that won&#8217;t make much difference with me,&#8221; Steve assured
him. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span> &#8220;Yes, and
I might add I hope that mother cat is the only specimen of her race up here,
too. It would be tough on us to run across another holdup, so we&#8217;d be
between two fires.&#8221;</p>

<p>It grew constantly darker. Undoubtedly Jack must be right about the heavens
having clouded over in the west. Steve found another source for worry. This time
it did not partake of the nature of animal foes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, wouldn&#8217;t it be a joke on us now, Jack, if a regular old
drencher came on, and soaked us to the skin? I&#8217;m listening in expectation
of hearing the mutter of thunder in the distance. After all, this wonderful day
seems bent on bringing us face to face with a number of queer happenings. There,
was that a growl of thunder then, or could it be another of those queer blasts
we heard before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither, I reckon, Steve. I think it was only the wind rising, and
making a moaning sound among some treetops. I&#8217;ve heard it call out in a
way to make you think some poor fellow had been caught under a falling tree, and
was being slowly crushed to death. Yes, there it goes again, you
notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But doesn&#8217;t it sound spooky, though?&#8221; ventured Steve,
looking hastily over his right shoulder for luck. &#8220;Does that spell rain to
you, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly like to say, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if we did have
a spell of it before morning,&#8221; the other went on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>&#8220;I only hope
then it&#8217;ll have the decency to hold off till we&#8217;re safe back in camp
again,&#8221; Steve ventured. &#8220;That tent is guaranteed to shed water in
the hardest downpour. Mr. Whitlatch, the town photographer, has tested it many
times and promised that it would not leak a drop; only you&#8217;ve got to keep
from touching it when wet with your fingers, because that&#8217;s a bad thing to
do, and may start a drip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both boys found themselves bending over more than at any previous time during
the return journey. This was all on account of the gathering darkness, for with
the passage of every minute the task of seeing their tracks was becoming more
difficult.</p>

<p>&#8220;This thing is getting pretty tough,&#8221; wheezed Steve, finally.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got fairly decent eyes, but I own up they&#8217;re going back
on me pretty fast trying to pick up our trail of the morning. How far away are
we from camp, do you reckon, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour&#8217;s tramp yet,&#8221; he was told with an assurance that
surprised Steve. &#8220;If you&#8217;re wondering how I can tell, I&#8217;ll
show you. Don&#8217;t you remember our stopping to take a good look at this
queer twisted tree that seems to be trying to make its straight neighbors
support it? Well, I remember that we were just about one full hour out when we
got here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes you to notice everything, Jack. I never once thought to pay
any attention to our time when we were going, except to count the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span> hours until it would be
near noon, and feeding time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about that snack you saved over?&#8221; chuckled Jack, who knew
what the answer was bound to be, because he had often seen Steve nibbling on the
sly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone long ago, every crumb of it,&#8221; came the frank admission,
&#8220;and right now there&#8217;s beginning to crop up a strong desire for more
grub. I hope Toby thinks to have supper all ready for us when we do get
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve was limping more or less now as he trailed along behind the leader. He
felt tired, and that heel bothered him again; besides, sheltered by the friendly
darkness he thought he was at liberty to shuffle along in any old fashion that
offered him the most comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll ease up on the eye strain a bit for one thing,&#8221; Jack
was saying as he fumbled at one of his pockets.</p>

<p>Suddenly a brilliant shaft of white light shot out ahead of them. Steve gave
utterance to a startled cry, in which delight was mingled with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you fetched along one of those hand-electric torches, did you,
Jack?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Well, a flashlight never had a better chance
to make itself useful than right now. It&#8217;s going to be a picnic from here
on. I can see every little twig and blade of grass; and as for our trail, a
fellow could follow it with one eye shut. Thank goodness! our <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span> troubles for the day are
ended; unless it comes on to rain cats and dogs before we get under
shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cast frequent anxious glances aloft whenever the trees were open enough to
allow of a view of the sky. There were no stars visible, as must have been the
case had it not clouded over; because the hour had grown late enough for an
exhibition of the usual heavenly display.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to say it, Jack, but I really thought I felt a drop right
then,&#8221; Steve remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can stand it all right, if we have to,&#8221; commented the other,
as though determined not to be cast down by such a trifling happening. &#8220;I
have a hunch that it won&#8217;t amount to much, if it rains at all.
What&#8217;s a little wetting between friends, tell me? And neither of us
happens to be made of sugar or salt. This sort of thing lends variety and spice
to an outing in the woods. It would be too monotonous if every single thing just
happened as we planned it. Besides, we have gone half an hour since leaving that
twisted tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, just then it seemed to me I could glimpse some sort of a light
ahead of us. Toby might have built a roaring fire, to cheer us up as we came
along the back trail. Yes, there I could see it flame up again, over the trees
and against the background of the clouded sky. We&#8217;re getting close to
home, thank goodness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you, Steve, for I saw it just as you said. Toby, like a
good fellow, has started up a big fire. He must be getting a bit anxious <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> about us by this time, and
you can&#8217;t blame him much. No one likes to be left alone in camp all day,
and then have a dark night come along, with prospects of a storm,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I give him a shout, Jack? It&#8217;ll ease the poor
fellow&#8217;s mind some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just one whoop, then, Steve. He&#8217;ll understand, and can be
finishing supper while he waits. How about that rain now; have you felt any more
drops?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I own up I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; confessed Steve, &#8220;and mebbe
I was mistaken about thinking as I did. Queer how things somehow do manage to
clear up. Often what we dread never happens at all. That old cat didn&#8217;t
tackle us, though I felt sure she would; the storm hasn&#8217;t caught us yet,
if I did count on getting soaked through; and there lies the camp before
us,&#8221; as a sudden turn in the trail allowed them to catch a glimpse of a
still distant fire that seemed to leap upward wildly.</p>

<p>The thought of soon arriving at the end of their long tramp gave both lads
additional vigor, so that they actually increased their pace, and made better
time in the last half mile of the journey.</p>

<p>Toby could be seen bustling about as though he had heard Steve&#8217;s whoop,
now and again he would stand and shade his eyes with his hand as he stared into
the darkness over the fire. Thinking to add to his peace of mind Jack flashed
his light several times as a signal, which he knew the other would understand,
for Toby had been with him <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_78'></a>78</span> when the hand-torch was purchased, and knew all about
it.</p>

<p>Finally they reached the camp. How welcome did the sight of the big
khaki-colored tent, that cheery campfire, and the friendly wagon standing close
by seem to the eyes of the tired stragglers as they stalked in and threw
themselves down on the ground to rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supper all ready, fellows, just when you say the word,&#8221; cheerily
chirped Toby Hopkins; &#8220;but if you&#8217;re overly tired you&#8217;d better
take things easy a bit before eating.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE NIGHT ALARM</span></h2>

<p>Steve was so ravenously hungry after his long tramp that he could not be held
back long. Doctors might say it was very bad to eat when exhausted, but what boy
was ever known to restrain himself on that account?</p>

<p>So they settled down on the logs, and had a surprise in store for them,
because Toby had actually fashioned a rude sort of table from several boards
fetched along in the wagon for that very purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is something like,&#8221; burst out Steve, when he found the
dishes being spread before him, and caught a scent of a savory stew the cook had
prepared in vast quantities, knowing Steve as he did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I haven&#8217;t any tablecloth and napkins to do the thing up
brown,&#8221; ventured Toby, whereat a shout went up from the others, who
violently declared that such things were taboo in the woods, and never see
unless there were ladies in camp.</p>

<p>Of course it was only natural that Toby should be eager to learn of their
adventures during the long day; but he knew nothing could induce them to talk
until at least the raw edge of their clamorous appetites had been taken off; so
he continued to ply them with more food.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>Jack, seeing the
mute look of entreaty in Toby&#8217;s face finally took pity on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you&#8217;ll want to hear what sort of time we&#8217;ve met with,
Toby,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and how we had to hand over the laurel wreath of
victory to one old mother cat that somehow seemed averse to letting us go
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cat!&#8221; ejaculated Toby, and then he looked wise; &#8220;Guess
you must mean a lynx, don&#8217;t you, Jack, and with whelps in the bargain.
Whee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, this was a wildcat of the ordinary variety,&#8221; Jack told him.
&#8220;A Canada lynx is an altogether different object, and has tasseled ears
that make it look mighty queer. But Steve here will tell you why we didn&#8217;t
dare tackle the old lady when she threw down the gauntlet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know!&#8221; cried Toby. &#8220;Tell me how it came about,
Steve. I noticed that both of you seemed to be carrying pretty hefty clubs when
you came in. So there <i>are</i> ferocious wild beasts at large up here in the
Pontico Hills country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferocious is hardly the word to describe that wildcat, I tell you,
Toby,&#8221; said Steve. &#8220;Wow! how she did spit and snarl until a
fellow&#8217;s blood ran cold. And when we glimpsed her yellow eyes they seemed
to glow like phosphorous.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the story was told by degrees, Steve liking to linger when he reached the
point where their progress was barred the second time by the audacious and
persevering feline foe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it too bad you didn&#8217;t have the shotgun <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span> along just then,&#8221;
observed Toby, &#8220;because you&#8217;d have easily knocked that beast over,
and ended its ugly career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I said several times,&#8221; Steve asserted, &#8220;and
I&#8217;d have been tickled half to death at the chance; but then I don&#8217;t
believe Jack would have fired, even if we had the gun along. You see, it would
have told anybody within a mile of the spot how we were poking around, and
that&#8217;s something against his plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both looked yearningly toward Jack, but he only smiled, and made no
remark, upon which Steve sighed, and shook his head as if to confess that it was
no use trying to tempt their leader to anticipate his promised disclosure by
even an hour.</p>

<p>By degrees everything was told, even to some of the remarkable sights that
they had run across during their tramp. Steve spoke of the enormous tree
alongside of which he had stood while Jack snapped off a picture, so as to show
by comparison just what a magnificent old forest monarch the mighty oak was.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and they were enjoying every minute of the time. It felt so
good to be back in camp again. Those among my boy readers who have ever been
through a similar experience can easily understand the sensation of solid
comfort that took possession of Steve as he lolled there, filled to the limit
with supper, and enjoying the crackling fire in a way words could never
describe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>Jack seemed to
have recovered from his fatigue, for he was busying himself in some sort of way.
Steve, too well satisfied with his position even to move, watched him for some
time, while Toby, like the good fellow he was, wrestled with the pots and pans
and pannikins that had been soiled with getting supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me, Jack, what in the wide world you&#8217;re
doing with all that dark-colored cord, and those tin pans in the bargain?&#8221;
Steve finally burst out with, unable to restrain his bubbling curiosity
longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to save our bacon, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; replied
the other calmly; but this explanation only increased the mystery; so far as
Steve was concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;m particularly stupid tonight, because I&#8217;m
tired, Jack,&#8221; he went on to say, desperately; &#8220;but, honest now, I
don&#8217;t get the hang of it at all. What do you mean by saving our bacon?
Does that apply to our fine pork products in the wagon yonder; or are you
hinting that perhaps our lives are in danger, and you&#8217;re fixing up a game
to keep us from going under?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack chuckled as he explained further.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got our provisions in mind when I designate them all under
the general name of bacon, you understand, Steve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how are they in danger of being carried off, Jack? I wonder now if
you suspect that hungry old mother cat would follow us all the way <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span> here, with the idea of
making a night raid on our well stocked larder. Could she know we must have
plenty of grub along in camp? Please explain a little further, won&#8217;t you,
Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a two-legged thief I&#8217;ve got in mind, you see,&#8221;
he was told. &#8220;Have you forgotten what we said that perhaps the easiest way
to make us clear out of the Pontico Hills country would be by stripping us of
all our grub? Well, it&#8217;s to prevent the possibility of such a calamity
overtaking us that I&#8217;m working this game right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve evinced new interest on hearing this. He even bestirred himself, and
limped over to see what Jack was doing at closer range. After watching for a
short time, he gave a laugh as though he had solved the puzzling mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m on to your fine game now, all right, Jack, old
scout!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he saw the other fasten one end of the cord to a
collection of tins which he had assembled in a heap. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to
be a sort of home-made alarm clock, I reckon. You&#8217;ve fixed that cord low
down near the ground, so a man can&#8217;t get near the wagon without brushing
up against it. When he does he&#8217;s apt to break the cord and that&#8217;ll
let the bunch of tins drop down from where they&#8217;re dangling. Whoop! what a
glorious jangle there&#8217;ll be about that time. I warrant you the intended
thief will get the scare of his sweet life, and how he will run like
mad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve guessed it finally, Steve, though it did take you a long
while,&#8221; Jack assured him. &#8220;And <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_84'></a>84</span> we&#8217;ll have the gun handy, so as to send a shot
up in the air, and add to his terror. Of course I may be off in my guess, and no
one may visit us tonight, or any other night during our stay. But then lots of
business men insure their houses and their goods when they never dream that they
will have a fire. This cord is our insurance policy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sang out Toby, who had been eagerly listening to all this
talk, although up to that point taking no part in the same, &#8220;an ounce of
prevention is always better than a whole pound of cure. They say, too, that a
stitch in time saves nine, though I&#8217;ve had many a one in my side, and it
didn&#8217;t save me at all. But Jack, it&#8217;s a bully good scheme all right,
and ought to work first rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can just imagine three fellows about our size piling out in the wee
small hours of the night, clad in their striped pajamas, and hearing a scared
individual go whooping through the woods, banging up against every other tree as
he runs. It will be a great picnic, for us I mean, boys; and I&#8217;m half
hoping he does come along this very night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that rain, Steve?&#8221; asked Jack, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, would you believe me, it has actually cleared up again, with all
the stars shining up there like fun? Which goes to show the folly of borrowing
trouble, eh, Jack? There I was, figuring out just how it&#8217;d feel to be wet
to the bone, and all that stuff, when never a drop came down. I had my worry for
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>&#8220;It happens
lots of times with most people,&#8221; chuckled Jack. &#8220;There, I think that
ought to fill the bill. The string isn&#8217;t very strong, and even a slight
knock will serve to break it, because you see it&#8217;s being held pretty taut
by the weight of all those tin pans. Once that happens and you&#8217;ll hear
Rome howl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll sleep easier, because of your precaution,
Jack,&#8221; asserted Toby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I just <i>know</i> I shall,&#8221; added Steve. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
worried a lot about our supply of eats, and it gave me a pain even to think of
them being stolen. But if the trap only works like it promises to do,
we&#8217;ll be safeguarded all right. If the marauder means to come over the
same distance we covered, Jack, he&#8217;ll be doing great stunts. And then
there&#8217;s that cat to consider in the bargain. Oh! I hardly think
we&#8217;ll be bothered tonight, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later on they retired to their blankets. Steve declared that he would not
need to be rocked to sleep that night, and that there was nothing like
exhaustion to induce good sound slumber. Toby had kept himself busy much of the
day, finding many things to do about the camp, following out various suggestions
which Jack had mentioned in talking matters over, and which of course he had
meant himself to undertake when the right time came along. So Toby was tired
also and ready to welcome the &#8220;call of the blankets,&#8221; as Steve
humorously designated the proposition to go to bed.</p>

<p>Jack took a last look around. He wished to be <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span> sure everything was secure in case a rain
storm did drop in upon them during the remainder of the night; or some
light-fingered gentleman invaded the camp, on looting bent.</p>

<p>Finally he too crept inside the canvas. They were eventually tucked away
snugly in their warm blankets, and had said the last goodnights as the lantern
was extinguished, and darkness reigned within the tent.</p>

<p>Outside, the fire burned low, since Jack did not see any necessity for
leaving much of a blaze when it was a summer night. Besides, there must always
be more or less danger of embers being blown about by an increasing night
breeze, possibly to start an incipient conflagration amidst dead leaves gathered
behind some log, and thus cause trouble, for it is often much easier to start a
fire than to put one out.</p>

<p>It must have been midnight or some time past when the trio of campers were
suddenly aroused by a most terrific clamor. It sounded as though all the small
boys in Chester had secured dishpans and such instruments of ear torture, and
assembled with the idea of giving a village serenade to some newly wedded folks
who would be expected to treat the bunch to cakes and fresh cider.</p>

<p>Although possibly a bit confused on being so abruptly aroused from sound
slumber by such an unearthly din, Steve, as well as Jack and Toby, instantly
grasped the stunning truth&#8211;that was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_87'></a>87</span> the alarm which had been rigged up to give fair
warning that their precious stores were being raided. A thief had invaded the
camp and unconsciously disclosed his presence in this loud-tongued brazen
fashion.</p>

<p>It was now up to them to appear hastily on the scene and add to his alarm in
every way possible. So acting in concert they all started to crawl out from
under the canvas, Jack clutching the double-barrel shotgun in his hand.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RASCALLY THIEF</span></h2>

<p>Could any one blame those boys for feeling highly worked up just about that
time when they were hustling to get outside the canvas shelter, and see what
strange things were taking place? The din created by the sudden fall of the
bunch of tin pans was still ringing in their ears. And doubtless all manner of
wildly exaggerated ideas must be crowding their brains in that same brief space
of time.</p>

<p>Each had something to do in the general line of self-defense as arranged for
in case such an event transpired while they slept. There was Jack holding the
gun as became the leader of the flock. Behind, and crowding close upon his
heels, came Steve, bearing his jolly big club, with which he felt able to flay
even a wildcat, and he had quite a notion, too, along that same line. Toby
brought up the rear, not because of any undue timidity on his part, but because
somebody had to &#8220;take the drumstick,&#8221; as his father was wont to say
when they had turkey, and in this case all of them could not be either first or
second; so Toby guarded the rear.</p>

<p>He grasped the flashlight in a trembling hand, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span> and his orders were to make use of it
just when Jack gave the word.</p>

<p>The night was dark, very dark, in fact. The old moon had not yet put in an
appearance in the eastern sky, which went to prove how aged and dilapidated it
must indeed be to rise at such a late hour. As for the fire, it was entirely
extinct by this time, and not able to render the first aid in time of need.</p>

<p>Every fellow, upon emerging began to look eagerly around him. Just what
Steve, for instance, expected to discover would be a difficult question to
answer. He may still have had in mind Mrs. Bobcat and her brood of kits, and
half anticipated being called on to offer fight in order to defend the camp.
Anything seemed possible with that brooding and mysterious darkness hanging over
the place. Its sable depths might be peopled with a great variety of goblins,
and unnatural wood folks, gathered to expel these rash, invaders of their
haunts.</p>

<p>After that one general look around Steve focused his sight upon the
particular spot where, as he well knew, the wagon had been standing at the time
they sought their blankets.</p>

<p>Well, it was still there, if that fact could afford him any satisfaction. He
could just manage to dimly make it out in the darkness, for very little
starlight found entrance through an opening aloft in the interlocked treetops
and branches.</p>

<p>Even as he looked Steve felt sure he saw some <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span> object move as though it were possessed
of life. That caused him to have another nice thrill that sent a shiver up and
down his spine.</p>

<p>Jack was already starting to creep that way, trailing his gun along, which
weapon he held in such a fashion that it could be brought into use without the
loss of more than a second.</p>

<p>About this time Toby began to forge alongside Steve. He had remembered that
he was the torchbearer of the trio, and on that account had no business to be
hanging in the rear, when Jack at any second might call upon him to make use of
the flashlight.</p>

<p>Strange noises greeted them, of which they could make nothing. Indeed, Steve
was of the opinion that possibly two persons were scuffling over there by the
supply wagon; for he likened the queer sounds to half-suppressed breathing, and
such struggles as wrestlers might indulge in. He could not make it out at all,
nor why two invaders of the camp should pick upon one another in such a
ridiculous manner.</p>

<p>There, that sounded like a blow; and it was immediately followed by a plain
grunt, as though the recipient of the stroke had had his wind partly knocked out
of him.</p>

<p>If only Jack would give the order for Toby to flash his light on the scene,
doubtless the mystery might be explained. But so far he had kept silent on this
score, although still creeping stealthily forward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>Steve, wondering
still, and trembling a whole lot in the bargain, believed he could understand
what Jack must have in his mind. He wanted to get close enough up before
betraying their presence, so that he could cover the pilferers, and let them see
that they were in range of a deadly weapon, so that to run away would very
likely get them into a peck of trouble.</p>

<p>The strange sounds kept up, and in an increased ratio, Steve figured.
Undoubtedly whoever it was making them must be growing more and more vehement,
as though something which was badly wanted managed to evade his clutch. Even the
racket produced by those clanging tin pans had not frightened the intruder away,
which Steve considered most amazing indeed. He felt sure that had he been
invading a camp, and had such a fearful noise suddenly broke out, he must have
taken wildly to his heels, and made a record run of it in order to escape the
consequences of his folly.</p>

<p>Then Steve caught what was plainly a loud snort, as of triumph. This gave him
a new idea, and which was hardly calculated to increase his comfort very
much.</p>

<p>Why, that was hardly such a sound as a human being would emit, being much
louder, and along harsher lines. Then what else was likely to make it? Jack had
said a considerable number of wild game must exist among these same Pontico
Hills; indeed, on the way there had they not seen a live <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span> doe and fawn; then there was the red fox
with the big brush of a tail that had slunk out of their path while they were
making their way through the woods; and last, but far from least, Steve
remembered the adventure with the wildcat and her kits.</p>

<p>If in the brief space of their stay they had already run across such a
variety of game animals would it not be safe to believe there might also be
other species roaming the woods, and seeking to secure their daily meals
wherever they could find them?</p>

<p>Now Steve had never seen a bear at large, nor yet a wolf at liberty, but like
all other wideawake boys he had fairly doted over these beasts when held in
captivity in the circus or menagerie that annually visited Chester.</p>

<p>Would a bear, for instance, be apt to make such snorting sounds when
searching the wagon for some prize tidbit that its keen scent told it was to be
found there? Steve believed even this might be possible. He gripped his club
with a firm conviction that there would soon be a little ruction taking place
around that immediate region beside which the famous Donnybrook Fair in Ireland
could never hold a candle, &#8220;to use the language of his own
thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>But then, of course, Jack must shoulder the main brunt of the fight, because
he had the gun in his possession. Steve only hoped Jack would be able to send
his first charge straight into the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_93'></a>93</span> heart of Bruin, so as to bring him down immediately.
That would save them all from a rough-and-tumble encounter where claws and teeth
would be apt to play havoc with their cuticle, and render their faces far less
attractive than when they left home.</p>

<p>How about the law? Steve asked himself, for it seemed as though in that
minute of time the boy&#8217;s active brain were capable of grappling with every
sort of question, and finding an adequate answer. Of course bears were protected
in the summer close season; but when a fellow&#8217;s life was at stake no game
law had a right to force him to lay down and allow a measly bear to walk all
over him, as well as steal his precious grub.</p>

<p>So in a flash of time Steve settled that matter in his mind, all right. Jack
would be acting well within his privilege as a citizen of the State if he
defended his property against robbery. No law could touch him for doing that;
and then besides, they could bury Mr. Bruin down deep, so that the game wardens
would never find a trace of him there.</p>

<p>Steve really felt better after settling this weighty matter. Of course it
still remained for Jack to carry out the provisions of the plan of campaign; but
then Jack was a fellow with steady nerves, and might be trusted to do his part
without a slip-up. Only Steve did rather envy him the privilege of actually
shooting a big, hairy bear; for later on what a great thing it would be <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span> to tell to some of the
Doubting Thomases of Chester. Yes, before burying the defunct beast they ought
to remember to cut off one of his great paws with its ugly claws, so as to have
some trophy to show as positive proof of their story.</p>

<p>Well, while Steve&#8217;s active mind was fixing all these wonderful details
with so much accuracy they were all three of them creeping along inch by inch,
and drawing nearer and nearer to the scene of activity.</p>

<p>Instead of diminishing the strange sounds actually increased in volume. They
were now accompanied by a crunching, of which Steve could make nothing, for he
was not sufficiently acquainted with the peculiarities of bears to know how they
acted when foraging for food, and climbing into a covered wagon at that in
search of the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was Toby trying to speak in a whisper, but his voice was wofully weak,
and moreover had a strange tremor about it that at another time would have made
Steve laugh uproariously; but he did nothing of the kind now, partly because he
suspected he could not have delivered himself in any stronger tones if he had
attempted to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; came in a sibilant whisper over Jack&#8217;s
shoulder; for he was only a few feet ahead of the other pair of crawlers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I better shoot with the flashlight now?&#8221; asked Toby
eagerly, showing how he had not forgotten what his line of duty was, in spite of
all <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span> the excitement
attending their issuing from the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the word right away, so be ready,&#8221; Jack told
him, cautiously; but the sounds over there at the wagon continued just as
vehemently as before, and it was plainly evident that the thief cared little or
nothing about their presence near by. &#8220;He&#8217;s around at the back of
the wagon, and I&#8217;m trying to get so as to cover him properly. Another six
feet ought to do the business, so keep steady, Toby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m as steady as a rock!&#8221; affirmed the one who carried
the flashlight; but it must have been a very wobbly rock then, if his bodily
condition corresponded with the decided quaver in his shaky voice.</p>

<p>Ten seconds later and Jack suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn the light on the rascal, Toby!&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby hastened to comply with the demand. Just as he did so they were thrilled
to hear a flickering whinny, a very sociable whinny in fact, coming from the
rear of the covered wagon. Then as the strong white glow shot forth they made a
wonderful discovery.</p>

<p>The dreadful thief was disclosed in all his grim proportions. He stood there
with his stubby tail switching back and forth, and contentedly munching great
mouthfuls of oats which he had managed to secure from the gaping sack, opening
which had doubtless given him all the trouble and caused those strange
grunts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>Yes, they
recognized him as soon as the light fell on his sides, and Jack instead of
raising the gun to his shoulder instantly let its muzzle drop to earth. For it
was only gaunt old Moses, the beast of burden, broken loose, and hunting the
fountain head of what he considered his too meagre meals.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>FISHERMAN&#8217;S LUCK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s only our old Moses after all!&#8221; cried Steve, as
though the astounding truth had burst upon him like a thunderbolt from a clear
sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s trying to founder himself with the whole supply of
oats, the rascal!&#8221; Toby added, indignantly.</p>

<p>But Moses was not afraid of foundering, apparently. He just gave another
contented whinny of delight, whisked that impudent stump of a tail of his, and
plunged deeper into the oat sack, which he had succeeded in getting open.</p>

<p>Jack was perhaps the least surprised of the trio, and even he had not more
than begun to suspect the true state of affairs when the light was turned on. He
doubled up with laughter, for it was really comical to see how eagerly Moses was
delving into his oat supply, as though he feared he was now about to be divorced
from his feast, and retired in disgrace, wherefore he wished to gobble all he
could while the golden opportunity lasted.</p>

<p>After they had all had several convulsions of merriment Steve concluded it
was time they took things in hand. Such dreadful liberties could not be allowed,
or the offense condoned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to make him break away from those oats, that&#8217;s all there is about
it,&#8221; he went on to say, seriously. &#8220;A poor old nag of a horse never
knows when he&#8217;s had enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Horses don&#8217;t happen to be alone in that class, Steve,&#8221;
chirped Toby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind about that,&#8221; snorted the other; &#8220;and it
doesn&#8217;t become you to give me a dig, Toby, because for a fellow of your
size you can go me one better when it comes to eating. But, Jack, we ought to
put a stop to this midnight feast, hadn&#8217;t we? Oats cost money, and even
horses have their price in the market.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing, Steve,&#8221; chuckled the one addressed, as stepping
forward he endeavored to lead Moses away from the tail end of the wagon.</p>

<p>The old horse strenuously objected, and upon finding Jack determined he took
one farewell grab at the fine contents of the sack, so that he could have
something to munch on for a while afterwards. He gave repeated backward looks
toward the wagon, and seemed very unhappy when all his dreams of a glorious
feast had been knocked on the head after this rude fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you hold him a minute or two, Steve,&#8221; remarked Jack,
&#8220;while I go and get into some clothes. This night air is salubrious all
right, but apt to set a fellow&#8217;s teeth to chattering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, it is so,&#8221; Toby acknowledged; but despite
his shivering he would not retreat to his warm blanket until the show had
ended.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Jack hurried as
best he could, having pity on his chums. When he came back partly dressed he
sent them to their beds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tie up old Moses so he won&#8217;t be apt to get loose
again in a hurry,&#8221; Jack advised them, and adding a bit reproachfully,
&#8220;for you must have been in a hurry after watering him in the evening,
Steve. After this I&#8217;ll make it a point to see he&#8217;s all right before
I turn in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the horse was led away, and his rope once more fastened, this time in such
a secure fashion that there was no possibility of its getting untied. He could
move around within a certain radius, and nip the sweet grass, as well as dream
of how close he had been to the greatest banquet of his natural life.</p>

<p>Before he went into the tent Jack reset the tin-pan trap. It had already paid
for what little trouble it caused him, because only for the alarm having been
given none of them might have heard Moses at his surreptitious work; and
consequently he would have devoured the entire two weeks&#8217; supply of oats,
or killed himself in the endeavor to dispose of them, which would have been a
calamity in several ways, both for Moses and the camping party.</p>

<p>Again did the little hand-torch come in for a meed of praise on the part of
the one who had to carry out all these things in the middle of a dark night.
Both the others seemed to be pretty far gone along the road to dreamland when
Jack <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span> crept under
his blankets. Toby did drowsily grunt, and ask if everything was all right, but
apparently hardly knew what he was saying; so Jack only answered with a word,
and cuddled under his coverings, for he felt a trifle chilled.</p>

<p>There was no further alarm that night. The expected prowler did not show up,
much to the satisfaction of all concerned; and morning found them in good shape.
Moses was already whinnying as to remind them that horses got hungry. Apparently
the old reprobate never knew what a close call he had had; left to his own
resources, morning might not have been so calm for him, if he lived to see the
sun rise at all. And as Toby wisely said, horse doctors must be as &#8220;scarce
as hens&#8217; teeth&#8221; up in the Pontico Hills district.</p>

<p>Somehow the adventure of the night seemed to appear even more comical when
viewed in the broad light of day. Toby in particular laughed every time he
thought of old Moses standing there, monarch of all he surveyed, and trying to
gulp the oats down like mad, as though he feared it was too good a thing to
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; Toby observed, as they sat at breakfast that
morning, &#8220;Moses actually seemed to have tears in his eyes when Jack here
forced him to leave the end of the wagon. Why, that was the one grand
opportunity of his life to stuff&#8211;a regular Thanksgiving jamboree spread
out before him. He kept turning his head and looking back as if he had lost his
best friend. If he&#8217;d been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_101'></a>101</span> going to the execution block I don&#8217;t think he
could have shown more regret. Poor old chap, it was almost cruel to cheat him
out of his feast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they turned their thoughts to other subjects, because, as Jack wisely
said, while this escapade on the part of Moses may have been a great event in
his life, it was only an episode with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How shall we spend today?&#8221; Jack asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, since you want to know my opinion,&#8221; spoke up Toby,
briskly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my mouth made up for another mess of those fine
and frisky Paradise River bass; and I&#8217;d like a whole lot to have one of
you fellows go over with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Steve?&#8221; queried Jack, turning to the partner of
his previous day&#8217;s long trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon I&#8217;d be wise to lay off a spell, because, to tell you the
truth that heel did give me a mite of bother, especially on the return trip. You
go with Toby, Jack, and take your camera along. He says there are some dandy
things you might want to snap off between here and the river. And in case either
of you hook a four-pound bass you can get a picture of the fight that will be
worth seeing, as well as of the beauty after he&#8217;s landed. I mean to get
over there later and try my luck, don&#8217;t forget, Toby, so leave a few in
the river, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was settled. Jack somehow did not seem disposed to take that long tramp
on two successive days, though doubtless he had certain plans arranged in his
mind which could be carried out <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_102'></a>102</span> later on. With nearly two weeks still ahead of them
it was needless to hurry matters. &#8220;Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a
day,&#8221; he often told the more impatient Toby, when the other was showing
signs of fretting because things failed to move quite as rapidly as he
wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just leave the things for me to look after,&#8221; said Steve, as they
arose after finishing breakfast. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought up a few jobs
I&#8217;d like to tackle while you&#8217;re away. And I&#8217;ll also agree to
see that old Moses doesn&#8217;t cut up any more of his capers. Have a bully
good time, boys. When do you expect to get back, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By noon, so far as I know now,&#8221; he was told. &#8220;We ought to
have all the fish we can use by then, if they bite at all; and the fishing is
never worth much from eleven to three. I&#8217;ll be able to snatch off any
pictures I&#8217;d care to take in addition; so look for us by twelve,
Steve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have lunch ready then, remember that, Toby,&#8221; called
out the campkeeper, as the pair started to the tent to get their fishing outfits
and the camera.</p>

<p>Toby having been over the route took it upon himself to act as guide to the
expedition. Indeed, a tyro could have found the way, for in going and coming
they had left quite a plain trail, easily followed.</p>

<p>Of course Jack was interested in everything he saw. Toby frequently called
his attention to certain features of the landscape which apparently <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span> had appealed to his love
of the beautiful on the former occasion. This showed that Toby kept his eyes
about him pretty much all the time; it also proved him to have an appreciation
of Nature&#8217;s handiwork, rather unusual in a boy.</p>

<p>They did not take much more than half an hour to cross over to the bank of
the Paradise River. Toby himself remembered skating this far up the stream
several winters back, but everything looked so entirely different in the
summer-time that he could hardly be positive about this.</p>

<p>It was a pretty scene, and with not a living human being in sight quite
appealed to Jack. Birds flitted from tree to tree; small woods animals were to
be seen frequently, and Toby even showed Jack where a deer had been down to
drink, leaving there a plain series of delicate hoof tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s try the place that treated me best of all,&#8221; he
went on to say, with all the consequential airs of a first discoverer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want several pictures of this spot,&#8221; Jack remarked, &#8220;but
they will do better along about ten o&#8217;clock, when the sun gets stronger,
and the contrasts are more striking. Besides, the fishing must come first, and
its always in its prime early in the morning. So get busy, Toby, and let&#8217;s
see who lands the first bass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack himself was something of a fisherman, as Toby well understood. Indeed,
he knew more about the habits of the tricky bass than any of <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span> the boys in Chester; for
as a rule they had been content simply to angle with a worm, and take
&#8220;pot-luck,&#8221; while Jack had read up on the subject, and even done
more or less fancy fly fishing amidst other scenes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Toby got the first fish. Perhaps this was because he knew just
how deep the water was, where a favorite swirl had yielded him several finny
prizes on the occasion of his former visit; or possibly just through &#8220;dumb
luck,&#8221; as he called it. There is no accounting for the freaks of fishing;
a greenhorn is just as apt as not to haul in the biggest bass ever taken in a
lake, where an accomplished angler has taken a thousand smaller fish from year
to year, yet never landed such a prize. &#8220;Fisherman&#8217;s luck&#8221; has
thus long become a famous saying.</p>

<p>However, Toby was not too exultant over his success. He fancied that before
they were done with the morning&#8217;s sport Jack would be giving him a pretty
lively chase for the honors.</p>

<p>They certainly did have plenty of fun, though perhaps the finny inhabitants
of Paradise River may not have enjoyed the game quite as well, since it was too
one-sided. Inside of an hour they had taken seven very good fish, really as many
as they could well use; though Toby kept saying that it was hard to gauge that
appetite of Steve&#8217;s, and one or two more wouldn&#8217;t come in amiss. It
is so easy for even a conscientious fisherman to find excuses for continuing the
sport as long as the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_105'></a>105</span> fish will bite, such is the fascination connected
with the game.</p>

<p>Then the expected happened. Jack had a tremendous bite, and was speedily
playing a fish that made his fine rod bend like a whip. Toby, forgetting his own
line, began dancing up and down on the bank, and urging Jack to play him
carefully.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MAN WITH THE PICKAX</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Toby excitedly, as the hooked fish leaped wildly from
the water, and tried to fall across the taut line, with the idea of breaking
loose, though Jack skillfully lowered his tip, and avoided that impending
catastrophe. &#8220;What a dandy, Jack! Three pounds, and mebbe a lot more. Look
at him fight, will you? He&#8217;s a regular old bronze-back warrior, I tell
you. I hope you land that beauty. Play him for all you&#8217;re worth, Jack;
please don&#8217;t let him get away. And now I hope Steve will say he&#8217;s
got enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t got him yet by a jugful, remember, Toby,&#8221;
remonstrated Jack. &#8220;They say you mustn&#8217;t count your chickens till
the eggs are hatched; and I tell you a big bass like that is never caught until
he&#8217;s flopping on the bank. They&#8217;re up to all kinds of tricks. Now
he&#8217;s boring down, and trying to find a rock to get under, so he can grind
the line, until it weakens and gives way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get to the bottom, Jack!&#8221; cried Toby,
anxiously. &#8220;That rod of yours will stand the strain all right. Give him
the butt, Jack; keep him on top of the water! Oh! but isn&#8217;t he a grand
fighter, though.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>Toby could
hardly have shown more interest had he been holding the rod instead of Jack; for
he was not a selfish lad. By slow degrees Jack began to tire the big bass out.
His rushes were losing some of their fierceness now, and the boy, shortening his
line as he found opportunity, was able to partly drag the fish along to help in
exhausting or &#8220;drowning&#8221; him, since his mouth was gaping open.</p>

<p>They had no landing-net, so Toby hastily stripped off shoes and socks in
order to wade knee-deep into the stream, and help get the prize safely ashore.
He would have willingly gone in up to his neck if necessary, to make a sure
thing of the landing part.</p>

<p>Jack wisely selected a little strip of shallow beach as the best place for
carrying out the finishing stroke of his conquest. Here Toby was able to use
both of his hands, and actually push the big bass along, until in the end they
had him safe on the shore, flapping still, as though his defiant spirit had not
yet given in to the adversity that had overtaken him.</p>

<p>Long they gloated over his beauty. Having no scales along they could only
guess at the weight of the prize. Jack said a good three pounds, but the more
enthusiastic Toby went half a pound higher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me much if he even tipped the scales
at four,&#8221; he assured Jack. &#8220;See how thick through he is, will you,
and a good <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
twenty-two inches long in the bargain. Oh! how he came down with a splash
whenever he&#8217;d jump two feet out of the water, and turn over! I&#8217;ll
never forget how finely you handled him, either, Jack, old chum! Now, if it had
been me I&#8217;d like as not have got so excited I&#8217;d lost my fish by some
fool play. But that ought to be enough for even Steve, and so I reckon we must
quit the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked dolefully toward the river, as though disliking very much to give
up when the acme of the sport had just been reached.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll take his mate another day, Toby,&#8221; Jack told
him, hopefully. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the old saying that &#8216;there&#8217;s
just as good fish in the sea as ever were caught,&#8217; and it applies to the
Paradise River in the bargain. And now I&#8217;ll wash up, so I can get busy
with my photographic work, as it&#8217;s about ten o&#8217;clock, and the sun as
strong as I&#8217;d want.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to have made up his mind just what pictures appealed most to him,
judging from the business-like way he went about his work. Toby stood by ready
to assist in any way possible, though he did not happen to be as greatly
interested in photography as his comrade. So after about half an hour Jack had
accomplished his task.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they ought to turn out pretty fine,&#8221; was his finishing
comment, as he closed his camera, the present of the lady who had engaged him to
combine business with pleasure on this camping trip. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span> &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything wrong
the fault will be wholly mine, because the conditions certainly couldn&#8217;t
be improved on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s home for us now, Jack?&#8221; asked Toby.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might as well be making a start,&#8221; he was told. &#8220;Perhaps
I&#8217;ll want to snap off another picture on the way, because one or two
things struck me as worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly Toby lifted the string of fish from the water, where they had
been keeping cool. He grinned as he pretended to stagger under the load.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, they&#8217;re going to turn out something of a weight,
Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll fix that soon enough, and share the burden,&#8221; the
other told him, as he picked up a stout pole, and proceeded to fasten the fish
to its centre. &#8220;Many hands make light work, they say, and when we carry
our prize bag of fish between us the strain will hardly be noticed.&#8221;</p>

<p>It proved just as Jack had said; what would have been a heavy weight for one
to carry was a mere bagatelle for both, thanks to that pole, which was some six
feet in length.</p>

<p>&#8220;First time in all my life I ever had to tote home a string of fish in
this way,&#8221; Toby confessed, though with brimming good humor.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t I wish we were going through Chester with the bunch, though;
how the fellows&#8217; eyes would pop out of their heads to see this whopping
big chap you landed. And I just know Steve will immediately <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span> press both hands on his stomach, and
say: &#8216;That&#8217;s about my size!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too hard on Steve, Toby,&#8221; chided Jack. &#8220;All
of us have our failings, and for one I&#8217;ve got my appetite along with me
pretty much all the time. He happens to be a big fellow, and in fine health, so
he feels hungry as many as six times a day, especially when in the woods, where
the air tones up the system.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving the river with some regret they started to head for the camp that lay
possibly a mile and a half away &#8220;as the crow flies.&#8221; Sometimes they
chatted as they walked along, and then again both of them would fall silent,
being taken up it might be with thoughts of those left behind in dear old
Chester.</p>

<p>It chanced to be during one of those quiet periods that Toby suddenly shook
the pole from which the string of fish dangled, as though endeavoring to attract
the attention of his companion without making any noise. Glancing toward the
other Jack saw him pointing with outstretched finger; and as he turned his own
eyes in the direction indicated he discovered the cause of Toby&#8217;s singular
behavior.</p>

<p>There was a man in sight, though just then, as he was bending over, he had
apparently failed to discover their nearby presence. Jack instantly sank down to
the ground, and Toby imitated his example; after which they crawled closer
together, until they could exchange whispers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_111'></a>111</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man!&#8221; was the first
low exclamation Toby gave utterance to.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who came to the camp, and asked questions, do you mean?&#8221;
demanded Jack, taking a cautious peep over the tops of the bushes that afforded
them an effectual screen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, he&#8217;s the same one,&#8221; Toby went on to say, decisively.
&#8220;I recognize his figure, and there, you can glimpse his face right now,
which I&#8217;d know among a thousand. But whatever can he be doing with that
pickax?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack seemed to be taking a deep interest in the actions of the mysterious
stranger. He watched him move a little further along, and then start to dig with
vigorous blows. They were quite close to him, and his face could be plainly
seen. Jack was studying it intently, as though he might be comparing its leading
features with a certain description that had been given to him.</p>

<p>When presently Toby saw his chum starting to get his camera in working order
he drew a breath of admiration, for he guessed that Jack was intending to try to
secure a snapshot of the man working with that pickax, as though desirous of
offering it as positive proof that could not be denied.</p>

<p>Creeping behind a neighboring tree the generous trunk of which offered him
the necessary asylum, Jack watched his chance. He waited until the man stood up
to rest, with the pickax held over his shoulder, and the sun well on his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span> Then a tiny click
announced to Toby that the thing had been done.</p>

<p>He was keeping his eyes glued on the man; but as several crows were holding a
noisy confab not far away, and a squirrel had taken to barking at the intruder
with the digging tool, such a slight sound as the clicking of the camera
apparently passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>The stranger seemed to be more or less excited. After mopping his perspiring
forehead he once more commenced digging here and there in a most tantalizing
fashion. Toby could not comprehend what it could mean. Was there gold or some
other precious deposit to be found up here among these hills, and might this
strange man be an old prospector from the West who had had long experience in
searching for mineral lodes? But then such things were seldom discovered so near
the top of the ground, Toby recollected. He wished the man would go away so he
could speak to Jack, and ask him what he thought; because the more he considered
the matter the greater became his conviction that Jack must surely know.</p>

<p>Now the man seemed to have satisfied himself, for he again shouldered the
pick, and started to leave the spot. Toby was glad to notice that he had turned
aside and consequently there would be no danger of his coming upon them in their
hiding-place. He waved a farewell after the other, boylike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodbye, Mister Man,&#8221; Jack heard him whisper, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span> exultantly; &#8220;come
again when you can&#8217;t stay so long. Your room is better appreciated than
your company. Who are you, anyway; and what&#8217;re you muddling about around
here, I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the man had been swallowed up in the depths of the woods Jack made the
other lie quiet for something like five minutes. This was to make doubly sure
the stranger did not turn on his tracks, and come back again. It was hard for
Jack to hold in, because he was quivering with eagerness to investigate, and see
if he could find out what had interested the other so much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess he&#8217;s gone for keeps, Jack,&#8221; suggested the eager
Toby, fretting like a hound held in the leash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it looks that way,&#8221; returned the other, commencing to get
upon his feet, &#8220;and I suppose we&#8217;d be safe in going on our way
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Jack, don&#8217;t you mean to take a peep over there where that
chap was digging so wildly to learn what he was up to?&#8221; demanded Toby.</p>

<p>Jack looked at him as though trying to make up his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it has to come some time,&#8221; he remarked, as if to himself,
&#8220;and I suppose it&#8217;s hardly right to keep you in the dark much
longer, now that you&#8217;ve seen as much as you have. So come along, Toby, and
we&#8217;ll investigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were quickly on the spot. Here and there could be seen evidences of the
man&#8217;s digging, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_114'></a>114</span> though he had hardly more than turned over the
upper crust of earth and rocks. So far as Toby could see there was not the first
sign of quartz, or anything else that, as he understood it, had to do with
mining. Indeed, just in that particular place the earth looked unusually grimy
and moist and oozy, a fact that struck Toby as surprising. Then he commenced
sniffing the air more and more vigorously, while over his face crept a smile
that kept growing broader and broader, as though the light of a great discovery
had burst upon him like a dazzling comet.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>WHEN THE SUN STOOD STILL</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I smell oil!&#8221; exclaimed Toby, &#8220;and that&#8217;s
what&#8217;s oozing out of the ground right here where the man was grubbing with
his tool! Jack, that was what he was looking for, wasn&#8217;t it? And you must
have known something about it right along, now I stop to think of a whole lot of
things that have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack was busy bending down and examining the oil-soaked earth. He even went
to the trouble of taking some of it and wrapping it in a piece of waterproof
paper he was carrying in his pocket; just as though he had prepared himself for
just such an occasion, the observing Toby thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re burning with curiosity to know what it means,
Toby,&#8221; he went on to say, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve finally made up my mind to
explain the solution of all this mystery, as well as tell you who and what that
man is. But you&#8217;ll have to content yourself with figuring out as many
explanations as you please between now and tonight, for I don&#8217;t want to
say a word until Steve is also present. I take it you&#8217;ve got head enough
to reason things out after a fashion, and grasp the answer. So don&#8217;t ask
me any questions, because I won&#8217;t answer until after supper.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;Then I
won&#8217;t tell Steve a single thing about this affair,&#8221; Toby went on to
say, although he looked a bit disappointed, because with noon still an hour away
it would be a terribly long time until they had seen the sun go down, and eaten
their evening meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be best not to get him excited in the bargain,&#8221;
advised Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a great surprise to Steve, too,
because he hasn&#8217;t been as keen as you on the scent, and is more in the
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And seeing this monster bass will be all the excitement he can stand
at a time,&#8221; chuckled Toby, beginning to make the best of the situation,
for he was usually an easy fellow to get along with, and Jack knew how to handle
him splendidly.</p>

<p>They started off again, but not before Jack carefully concealed the tracks
they had made. This he did to prevent the man from making a discovery should he
again visit the spot, which he was very likely to do, since it would naturally
have a species of fascination for him henceforth.</p>

<p>It was difficult for Toby to talk on any other subject while his mind was
filled with the strange actions of the man who seemed to resent their presence
in the neighborhood. Therefore he had little to say on the balance of the way
back to camp, though Jack knew he must be doing considerable thinking, that
would cover every angle of the case.</p>

<p>Of course Steve was delighted when he saw the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span> monster bass. He admired it from every
angle; though Toby took particular notice that Steve seemed more interested in
the glorious dish it would make when cooked than in the great fight it had put
up when at the end of Jack&#8217;s line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know I was just hoping you&#8217;d fetch such a dandy fish home
with you,&#8221; he went on to say, delightedly; &#8220;because I&#8217;ve made
all arrangements to bake it in an oven of my own manufacture. I&#8217;ve dug a
hole in the hard clay here, and when we&#8217;ve had lunch I mean to heat it
furiously with red embers. Then I&#8217;ll wrap that fish in a wet cloth and lay
it inside, after which my oven will be sealed over to keep the heat in for
hours. That&#8217;s the old hunter&#8217;s oven, and they do say it is the
originator of all these new-fangled fireless cookers, as well as the Thermos
bottles that keep things hot or cold for a whole day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Steve!&#8221; cried Toby, slapping the big chum on the back
affectionately. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a head on you after all, sure you
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve looked as though he considered this a dubious compliment, since it
seemed to imply that Toby must have at times doubted the truth of his assertion.
But Jack, after examining the earth oven, declared that it was sure to work
splendidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And six hours or so ought to be really enough to cook a fish,
especially if we get it as hot as we can,&#8221; he assured the architect.</p>

<p>In due time this was carried out. Plenty of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_118'></a>118</span> red embers were placed in the hole in the hard
clay, and covered over; still more being added until the place was furiously
hot. Then the ashes being taken out the cleaned fish was placed carefully
within, after which the top was sealed over with wet clay, making the oven a
&#8220;hermetically sealed one,&#8221; as Steve proudly proclaimed.</p>

<p>That was the longest afternoon Toby Hopkins ever knew during the entire
course of his young life. He seemed to look up at the sun forty times, as though
resting under a grave suspicion that some modern Joshua might have commanded it
to &#8220;stand still.&#8221; Steve began to notice his actions, and seemed
puzzled to account for them, being wholly unsuspicious of the real cause.</p>

<p>He even at one time about the middle of the afternoon sought Jack out,
finding him working at his negatives; for he had fetched along a little daylight
developing tank, and had already announced himself as well pleased with what the
results seemed to promise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, see here, there&#8217;s something wrong with our Toby,&#8221;
Steve said in a cautious voice, although the object of his remark being some
distance away there was not the slightest chance of his overhearing
anything.</p>

<p>Jack knew what was coming, but he did not even smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what makes you say that, Steve?&#8221; he asked,
solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s acting so queer that I&#8217;m afraid the poor <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span> fellow must be going
looney,&#8221; Steve told him, with a ring of sincere regret in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer in what way?&#8221; asked the other, continuing his work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! in lots of ways,&#8221; sighed Steve. &#8220;For one thing he
can&#8217;t keep still a minute, but jumps up, and walks around nervously. Then
he&#8217;s always looking up at the sun, and shaking his head as if he
couldn&#8217;t make things out. I&#8217;ve seen him looking at you as if he had
a grudge he was nursing. Now <i>something</i> has happened to Toby since he left
camp this morning, and I&#8217;d like to know what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, nothing has happened to him except that he&#8217;s seen a lot of
interesting things, the same as I have. We mean to speak of them after supper,
while we lie around taking our ease, you know. Don&#8217;t worry about Toby; I
give you my word the boy is all right. Little danger of him ever losing his
head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I even asked him point-blank what ailed him, and if he felt any
way sick, but do you know, he just smiled at me, and shrugged his shoulders in
the silliest way ever. Yes, and would you believe me, Jack, he gave me a queer
look and said: &#8216;I&#8217;m not a bit sick, I tell you; I&#8217;m only tired of
waiting,&#8217; and Jack, he wouldn&#8217;t even explain what he meant by that.
Even if you don&#8217;t feel bothered I do, and there&#8217;s something knocking
in Toby&#8217;s brain right now, I tell you. That boy has got something on his
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>&#8220;Listen,
Steve,&#8221; chuckled the amused Jack. &#8220;There may be a method in
Toby&#8217;s seeming madness. Remember the old story of the doctor who, being
called in to prescribe for an old gentleman addicted to much dram drinking, put
him on a strict allowance of one drink a day, which was to be taken when he sent
downstairs for his hot water for shaving. Some days afterwards, chancing to be
in the neighborhood again, he stopped at the door to ask how the old party was
getting on. To his surprise the butler held up his hands, and looked very solemn
as he declared that he very much feared his master was going out of his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And why do you fear that, James?&#8217; the doctor asked,
alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Because, Doctor,&#8217; said the butler, &#8216;every hour of the day the
master insists on sending down for hot shaving water!&#8217; And so you see,
Steve, there was a method in his madness, for the doctor knew why he wanted that
hot water. You give Toby credit for being a sensible chap. He&#8217;s only
counting the minutes until that fine fish is done to a turn, and you sound the
gong for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve looked a trifle relieved after that, though he still continued to watch
the uneasy Toby from time to time, and could be seen shaking his head as if his
doubts had returned in full force.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely the glowing orb dropped closer toward the horizon. A doomed
prisoner in his cell might have watched its going with dread, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span> as the setting of the
sun would bring the hour of his execution nearer; but with Toby it was just the
opposite, and he counted every minute as so much gain.</p>

<p>Steve had evidently gauged the appetites of his chums by his own, and fearing
the big fish might not go around for a third helping had prepared a panful of
the smaller bass besides.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell the first time you try out a new dodge,&#8221; he
offered in explanation of his bountiful provision, &#8220;and if after all my
oven failed to cook in seven hours why where would we be at for supper tonight,
I&#8217;d like to know. I&#8217;m a great hand for preparedness, you must know,
fellows; and here&#8217;s a fair taste all around, no matter what happens to the
roast fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it time we began to get busy eating,&#8221; sighed
Toby, looking so woe-begone that Steve, under the impression he must be almost
starved, thrust a lot of soda crackers and a piece of cheese into his hand,
saying sympathetically:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that will take some of the gnawing away, Toby, and keep you up
another half hour. I know how you feel, because haven&#8217;t I been there
myself many a time? I mean to take a look-in at my dandy oven soon, and if
everything is lovely we can start business at the old stand right
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor anxious Toby, how he did suffer. Evidently he had not been able wholly
to clutch the truth, strive as he might; and the solution of the mystery seemed
to be dangling there just beyond <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_122'></a>122</span> his reach, as though to tantalize him. Jack himself
wished the time would hurry and come so that he might keep his word and
&#8220;lift the lid,&#8221; in the way of explanations.</p>

<p>When Steve went to take a look at the oven Toby insisted on accompanying him;
and when the <i>chef</i> declared that the fish was done to a turn Toby beamed
with positive delight, as though the long agonizing period of his waiting was
now surely drawing near an end.</p>

<p>The big fish was simply elegant. The boys used up all the available
adjectives at their command in order to do the subject ample justice. Never had
a fish been better baked. Steve looked as proud as any peacock that strutted
along a wall in self-admiration. He even promised to repeat the prize supper, if
only Toby could duplicate Jack&#8217;s catch.</p>

<p>Again and again they all passed in for more until not only the big fish was
utterly gone but serious inroads had been made by them in the other mess.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I gauged our appetites fairly well after all,&#8221; Steve
was saying, as if to clear himself of any reproach along the lines of
greediness.</p>

<p>At length they one and all declared they were through, whereupon Toby sat up
eagerly, and turned an appealing face toward Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The time has come for you to keep your promise, Jack,&#8221; he went
on to say, considerably to the amazement of Steve. &#8220;So please start in and
tell <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span> us who that
man is we saw digging today; what he&#8217;s after up here in the Pontico Hills;
and just who the rich old lady in Chester may be who put up the cash to finance
this expedition. The whole story, mind, and nothing held back.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>JACK LIFTS THE LID</span></h2>

<p>If Toby&#8217;s manner was a trifle dictatorial when he made this demand,
perhaps he might be excused for feeling so. At least Jack did not seem to mind
in the least, if his smile stood for anything.</p>

<p>Toby had waited long, and suffered horribly. Minutes had dragged out in an
almost intolerable fashion as he watched the lagging sun creep down the western
heavens. But at last his time of triumph had come, when according to the
arrangement made between them he could ask Jack to redeem his promise of a full
confession.</p>

<p>As for Steve, he was staring as hard as he could, staring with his mouth
partly open after a habit he had when astonished. Of course he soon grasped the
idea, and across his face there began to creep a broad smile. He gave Toby a
grateful look, as though disposed to crown him with a laurel wreath becoming a
victor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you say, Toby, the time seems to have arrived when you fellows
ought to be told the whole story,&#8221; began Jack, as he settled back into an
easier position. &#8220;After what you saw today, and the discovery we both
made, it would be silly for me to keep you in the dark any longer. I <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span> only bound you not to
bother me about it until we&#8217;d had our supper, when Steve also might hear,
and so save me considerable talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, first of all I must tell you who the lady in the case is, and
how she came to pick me out as the one she thought could best help her. She is a
leader in the Red Cross work, and a woman well liked by nearly everybody in
Chester. Her name is Miss Priscilla Haydock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; burst out Toby, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking of
her ever since you let slip that our backer wasn&#8217;t a gentleman at all.
Why, they say she&#8217;s got stacks of money, and uses it freely for every good
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so very much surprised myself,&#8221; Steve told them,
composedly; &#8220;because I know Miss Haydock right well. She often visits at
our house; and my folks think a heap of her. But go on, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She sent for me one day, and I called at her house, where she told me
that she had a strange job for some one to do, and somehow felt that a wideawake
boy might answer a whole lot better than a man. She also said a few nice things
about having watched me on the baseball field, and how folks seemed to believe I
tried pretty hard to <i>get</i> there, whenever I had anything on my hands; but
I&#8217;ll omit the bouquet part of the interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming right down to brass tacks now, Miss Haydock informed me that
she owned pretty nearly all this Pontico Hills district up here. She <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span> had taken it some years
back simply as an investment, and was holding it in hopes that some fine day a
projected railroad would go through here, when it must become valuable
property.</p>

<p>&#8220;Latterly she had been bothered by a nephew of hers, a man from New
York City by the name of Mr. Maurice Dangerfield, who had been trying to get her
to allow him to have an option on the entire strip of land, under the plea that
he believed he had a customer who would purchase.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the price he offered was considerably more than what she had paid,
Miss Haydock was almost tempted to agree. On thinking the matter over, however,
she came to the conclusion not to be too hasty about deciding. She happened to
know this Dangerfield was a clever individual, who had, as a rule, made his
living by being smarter than most people. He told her he was in great need, and
that the commission he expected to receive, should the deal go through, would
save him possibly from becoming a bankrupt. He was working upon her generous
nature, you see, boys; but it happened that she knew a number of things not to
his credit, and so concluded to go slow about the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;So she wanted me to get a couple of my chums and spend several weeks
up in the Pontico Hills camping, the only provision being that we should take a
lot of pictures to show her what the country looked like. And I was to keep a
sharp eye out for any sign of Mr. Maurice, as well as learn, if I could, just
what he was up to.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>&#8220;She
showed me a picture of her smart nephew, and of course as soon as Toby here
described the gentleman who came into camp that day, looking so sour, I just
knew it must be he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, when Toby and myself today discovered a man poking about, and
using a pickax now and then, as though searching for minerals, I suspected
instantly that we were on the verge of a discovery, and it turned out that way.
We hid in the bushes, and I even managed to snap off the party, with his pick
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he had gone, Steve, we went over to see why he had been
scratching the soil as he did, and showing so many evidences of excitement.
Well, tell him what we found, Toby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oil!&#8221; ejaculated Toby, theatrically, and Steve almost fell over,
such was his astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean petroleum&#8211;crude oil?&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, in some places the ground was just rank with the black-looking
stuff,&#8221; Toby assured him. &#8220;I sniffed it even before we got on the
ground; and while I&#8217;m not wonderfully bright-witted, I didn&#8217;t have
the least trouble guessing what it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; continued Jack, &#8220;we don&#8217;t know just how
this Dangerfield ever got wind of the fact that the big tract of land owned by
his aunt showed traces of being an oil district, because there are no such
places within fifty miles of here; but he must have scented it out in some way,
and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span> then laid all
his pipes so as to tie the property up under an option.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it would be well worth a million, if a cent,&#8221; said Toby,
&#8220;in case the wells panned out half-way decent. I&#8217;ve read a heap
about this oil business, and how many a poor farmer who had never been able to
scratch a decent living from his hundred-acre farm, woke up some fine morning to
have speculators pounding on his door, and offering him all kinds of money up to
the hundreds of thousands of dollars to sell out to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s really all there is to the story,&#8221; Jack went on
to say. &#8220;You know as much as I do now. Dangerfield is here on the ground.
He&#8217;s conducting some sort of work over where we heard those explosions,
and I think he must be trying to put down an experiment well, so as to convince
the men he means to take into the deal with him that it means a fortune for each
one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Toby went on to say, breathlessly, &#8220;and mebbe those
dull shocks we heard came from their shooting the well. I understand they have
to start things with a blast of dynamite, when the gusher begins to
flow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be the case,&#8221; Jack admitted, &#8220;though I hardly
think a shrewd man like Dangerfield would go quite so far until he had actually
secured the option from his aunt. It may be he feels certain she will give it to
him, and is going ahead on that foundation. No matter, he certainly <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span> showed signs of being
mighty well pleased at what he saw today, didn&#8217;t he, Toby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what he did, Jack, as happy as a clam at high tide,&#8221; came
the answer. &#8220;Why, there was one time I actually thought the gent was
getting daffy, for he began to dance about like a darky boy, and slap his thigh
again and again. After that he hurried away. I guess if he had any doubts
lingering over, what he discovered today did for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As likely as not,&#8221; mused Jack, &#8220;he&#8217;ll go back to
Chester again, and try harder than ever to coax Aunt Priscilla to give him the
option, making out that he&#8217;s doomed to go to prison, and drag the family
name in the dust if she refuses. But she told me she was resolved not to take a
single step until she had my report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s goodbye to all those castles in Spain that Maurice has
been building on the strength of deceiving his rich aunt,&#8221; chuckled Steve,
as though highly amused at the way things were turning out, and proud of the
part he and his chums had taken in the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you satisfied with what you&#8217;ve learned so far, Jack?&#8221;
Toby wanted to know with an anxious look on his face. &#8220;I certainly do hope
you won&#8217;t be wanting to skip out of this the very first thing, and
breaking up our vacation camp before we&#8217;ve gotten settled down and hardly
more than started enjoying it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack smiled at the earnest manner of the other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>&#8220;That
would be too cruel, Toby,&#8221; he assured him. &#8220;If I thought it
necessary that Miss Haydock should know what we&#8217;ve learned, why, I&#8217;d
go myself and tell her, leaving you fellows here to keep camp while I was
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon the cloud gathering on Toby&#8217;s face was suddenly dissipated,
and he grinned happily again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I hope you won&#8217;t even have to think of doing that,
Jack,&#8221; Steve remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any necessity just yet,&#8221; Jack decided,
&#8220;and unless some new and very important developments come along I think I
can hold off until we all go back home. Besides, I hope to do a little more
looking around, and perhaps take more pictures while I&#8217;m up
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get you, Jack!&#8221; cried the alert Toby. &#8220;Chances are that
you&#8217;re making up your mind to drop in and see what they&#8217;re doing
over where those blasts came from. How about that for a guess, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hit the bull&#8217;s-eye plum centre that time, Steve,&#8221;
laughed Jack; &#8220;because while my plans are not exactly complete, I have
that in mind. But we&#8217;ll talk it over again. There&#8217;s no particular
hurry, you see, if we expect to stay here ten or twelve days longer. The more
time we take to enjoy ourselves the better it would look, in case a spy was
hovering about, trying to learn just what we wanted up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing sure, Jack, I hardly think we&#8217;ll be <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span> able to do much
tomorrow, because all the signs point to our having wet weather,&#8221; Steve
went on to say, with the air of a prophet who could read the signs about as well
as the head of the weather bureau at Washington.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a feeling in the air that way,&#8221; admitted Jack.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed it myself even if I didn&#8217;t say anything about
it. So I&#8217;m glad, Steve, that you proved a good provider while at home
today, laying in a fine stock of firewood that ought to last us through a couple
of days. It&#8217;ll come in handy in case we&#8217;re shut in by the
rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! we&#8217;re well fixed for anything like that, Jack,&#8221;
chuckled the other. &#8220;There&#8217;s that dandy camp stove we fetched along,
and haven&#8217;t had a chance yet to try out. I made a place in the tent for
it, and Mr. Whitlatch has an asbestos collar to use so that the pipe can&#8217;t
set fire to the canvas, no matter how red-hot it gets. Why, it would be well
worth enduring a rainy spell just to see how the thing works.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I haven&#8217;t forgotten either, Steve,&#8221; spoke up Toby,
&#8220;that you promised to make a fine batch of biscuits in the oven of that
same camp stove the first chance you got. I want to open that bottle of honey,
and have been keeping it to go on hot biscuits&#8211;of course providing
they&#8217;re a success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you worry about that,&#8221; said Steve, boldly.
&#8220;I took lessons from our hired girl, and she said my biscuits were mighty
near as good as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
hers. Why, at the table they were sure enough surprised when she told Mom
I&#8217;d made the bunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they chatted and laughed until it was time to turn in again.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>STORM-BOUND</span></h2>

<p>Well, it rained, just as the weather sharp had so wisely predicted.</p>

<p>Steve chanced to be the first to hear the drops begin to patter down on the
canvas covering that sheltered them from all inclemencies of the weather. He
gave a snort as he sat bolt upright and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, didn&#8217;t I tell you so, fellows; listen to her come down,
will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this row about?&#8221; grumbled the sleepy Toby,
hardly stirring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s raining, don&#8217;t you hear?&#8221; snorted Steve,
as though that might be a wonderful fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her rain pitchforks for all I care,&#8221; grunted Toby.
&#8220;Lie down and go to sleep again, can&#8217;t you, Steve? What do we care,
when this tent is guaranteed waterproof? Besides, haven&#8217;t we taken all
precautions? Only old Moses will get wet, and it isn&#8217;t going to hurt him
any. So please go to sleep again, and leave me alone. I was having the most
wonderful dream, and beating the whole crowd at skating for a wonderful prize of
a pair of silver-plated skates, when you had to go and spoil the whole show. Now
I&#8217;ll never get those skates, that&#8217;s sure.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>All through the
balance of that night the rain continued to come steadily down. At least it was
no great storm, with accompanying wind and the crashing of thunder. When morning
came it was a dismal outlook that they saw, peeping from the tent. The rain was
still falling, and a leaden gray sky overhead gave promise of a hopelessly long
and wet day.</p>

<p>Steve had fetched along a rubber coat and boots, so that one of them could go
and come on errands, without getting soaked. Moses must be fed, to begin with,
and there would be numerous trips to make between tent and supply wagon.</p>

<p>The fire was started in the little camp stove used by the photographer when
he took his annual pilgrimage through the country, in search of lovely views to
add to a collection he was making that would be an art treasure when he had
completed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that works mighty fine, let me tell you!&#8221; declared Toby,
when the grateful heat from the stove began to render the interior of the big
tent very comfortable. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have no trouble keeping as snug as
three bugs in a rug, with that sheet-iron contraption to help out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; added Steve, &#8220;the oven is getting hot already. I
really believe I can do that baking today, boys; so make up your minds to eat
some of the jolliest biscuits you ever put between your teeth. I made sure to
carry all the ingredients along, barring none.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>&#8220;I notice
that an arrangement comes with the stove so that you can burn kerosene if wood
isn&#8217;t handy,&#8221; remarked Jack; &#8220;which makes it all the more
valuable as a camp auxiliary. Lots of times wood is out of the question, but you
can get plenty of oil.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Steve began to chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What strikes you as being so funny, Steve?&#8221; demanded Toby, who
was amusing himself by starting breakfast on the little stove, as though not
meaning to let Steve do <i>all</i> the cooking while on their camping trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I was only thinking of that old saying about carrying coals to
Newcastle, you know&#8211;which place is the head coal centre over in England.
It would seem pretty much that way for fellows to lug a big can of kerosene away
up here, when the ground is actually reeking with the stuff in an unrefined
state. Perhaps it&#8217;d be possible to find a little pond of the same, and dip
up all you&#8217;d want to use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing I&#8217;m hoping won&#8217;t happen, at any rate while
we&#8217;re up here,&#8221; Toby now went on to say, reflectively; &#8220;and
that is to have the woods get afire. Whee! if that ever did happen, goodbye to
Miss Priscilla&#8217;s gold mine, in the way of an oil gusher bonanza; for the
whole country might get ablaze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much danger of that, I guess,&#8221; Jack assured him. &#8220;The
traces of oil we&#8217;ve seen must be only seepage. The main supply is hidden
far <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span> down in the
earth, and until wells are sunk will stay there safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>After all, it was very cozy there in the tent as long as the stove burned.
Fortunately the rain came from another direction, so they could have the flat
open, and so get a fair amount of light and air. The table could be dispensed
with during the time they were thus imprisoned, for being agile boys they did
not consider it much of a hardship to curl their legs under them, tailor
fashion, while they discussed their breakfast.</p>

<p>Steve later on got out a book of travel and adventure which he had fetched
along for a rainy day, but which, previously, he had not thought to look at. As
the morning began to pass he lay there on his blanket and devoured the graphic
account of hardships endured by some dauntless party of explorers who had sought
the region of the frozen Antarctic, and come very near losing their lives while
there. Now and again Steve would shiver and ask Toby if he wouldn&#8217;t please
drop the flap of the tent a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much I will,&#8221; protested that worthy, vigorously.
&#8220;It&#8217;s hot enough in here now nearly to cook a fellow, and none too
light, either. Suppose you tuck away that book of the ice regions, which is what
makes you shake all over when you&#8217;re reading about the terrible cold they
endured. Keep it for a sizzling hot day, Steve, when it&#8217;ll do you good to
shiver a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! guess I might as well,&#8221; grunted the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span> other, as though convinced.
&#8220;Besides, it&#8217;s getting on toward eleven, I reckon, and I really
ought to be thinking of starting my baking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re away off this time, Steve,&#8221; laughed Jack, who had a
little nickle watch along with him, though he seldom carried it on his person,
&#8220;because right now it is only a quarter to ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what a long day this promises to be,&#8221; groaned Steve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t beat yesterday in my opinion,&#8221; claimed Toby.
&#8220;I actually thought the sun was nailed fast up there in the sky, because
it didn&#8217;t seem to move an inch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you were on the job every second,&#8221; Jack
told him. &#8220;A watched pot never boils, they used to say; but of course it
meant that the water seemed to take an unusual time in bubbling.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Steve yawned, and lolled in his blanket, until finally Jack told him he
might as well get busy if they expected to have a feast of camp biscuits for
lunch.</p>

<p>It was no easy task which Steve had set himself. First of all he insisted on
going out and fetching the rude table inside the tent, even if it did crowd them
a trifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;However could you expect a <i>chef</i> to make biscuits, with never a
table to work at?&#8221; he threw at Toby when the latter ventured to complain;
and of course after that they allowed Steve to have his own way, though Toby
hung around to quiz him, until the other ordered him off.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_138'></a>138</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ll queer these delicacies if you
bother me any more, Toby,&#8221; he told him severely. &#8220;Our cook says you
ought almost to hold your breath when making them, because it&#8217;s always
easy for them to drop. Mebbe she was joshing me, but I don&#8217;t want to be
bothered and forget to put the baking powder or the salt in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toby kept a roaring fire going, and finally the pan of biscuits was popped
into the oven. Steve looked a bit anxious, realizing that his reputation as a
cook was now at stake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;ve got this table inside here,&#8221; spoke up Jack,
&#8220;we might as well make all the use of it we can, chucking it out again in
the rain when supper is over. Here&#8217;s a box one can sit on, and we&#8217;ll
rig up seats for the others somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Steve, on hearing this. &#8220;That gives my legs
a chance to keep out of snarls. I never could curl up like some fellows. But I
wonder how they&#8217;re coming on inside the oven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, your legs?&#8221; exclaimed Toby, jeeringly; &#8220;why, I
didn&#8217;t know we were going to be treated to roast <i>mutton</i> today, did
you, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve took a peep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, they&#8217;re beginning to turn a light brown already; and
say, they look as light as any Mary Ann ever made at our house,&#8221; was his
joyous announcement.</p>

<p>He seemed to act as though the fate of nations depended on the successful
issue of his first camp baking. Indeed, Toby was secretly almost as <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span> much concerned as Steve,
for he dearly loved hot biscuits, and counted himself a pretty good judge of
them.</p>

<p>To dismiss the subject, it may be said that Steve&#8217;s experiment turned
out to be a success. Jack congratulated him on making such dainty biscuits;
while Toby declared that the proof of the pudding lay in the eating; and the
fact that he was making such desperate inroads on the stack that graced the dish
in the center of the table showed his appreciation.</p>

<p>So Steve was made very happy, and readily promised that there would be no
lack of fresh bread while the stock of flour held out, and that dandy little
stove was in working order.</p>

<p>The afternoon proved terribly long to all of them. Sometimes they would take
turns at dozing, for the patter of the rain among the leaves, and on the canvas
above their heads, made a sort of lullaby that induced sleep. Several times the
rain would die out for a short time, only to make a fresh start again after
exciting false hopes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; observed Jack, as evening drew on apace, &#8220;we might
have been a whole lot worse off. The tent hasn&#8217;t leaked a drop, that
I&#8217;ve noticed; and thanks to the stove we&#8217;ve been comfortable enough.
Let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;ll rain itself out during the night, and give us a
chance to get moving tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>This did not prove to be the case, for it turned out to be one of those
easterly storms that usually <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_140'></a>140</span> last the better part of three days, with almost a
constant downpour, though not very heavy at any time.</p>

<p>When another day came, it was still dark and gloomy, though not raining just
then. They managed to get a chance to stretch themselves outside before it set
in again. Steve was the one who did most of the complaining, though Toby
grumbled quite a bit also.</p>

<p>Along toward noon, it brightened up some. Toby even declared with bated
breath that he fancied he glimpsed a tiny patch of blue sky, &#8220;large enough
to make a pair of trousers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the signs all show that it&#8217;s clearing off,&#8221; observed
Steve, exultantly, fixing his weather-sharp eye on the aforesaid patch of azure
sky. &#8220;You know the old saying is, &#8216;Between eleven and two it&#8217;ll tell
you what it&#8217;s going to do,&#8217; so I&#8217;m counting on our having a
decent afternoon of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His prediction proved to be correct. The clouds began to part, and at exactly
noon, according to Jack&#8217;s watch, the sun looked out from behind the dark
curtains that had hidden his genial face for so long a spell.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take the whole afternoon for the woods to get decently dry
again,&#8221; Jack was saying just then; &#8220;so we&#8217;ll have to keep
quiet for a little spell. But I&#8217;ve got a scheme on foot that will take two
of us away all of tomorrow, and perhaps the day afterwards, leaving one to guard
the camp. And you two fellows must toss up to see who goes, and who
stays.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE PROSPECTORS</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Well, for one, I don&#8217;t want to be kept in suspense so
long,&#8221; Toby began; &#8220;and I move we settle that question right away,
Steve, by drawing straws.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, it had better be you who goes with Jack, Toby,&#8221; the
other generously went on to say. &#8220;To tell you the truth I&#8217;m a little
afraid that heel of mine hasn&#8217;t just given up the fight yet, and a very
long tramp just now might make it hurt again like sixty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that wouldn&#8217;t be fair,&#8221; urged Toby, doggedly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to take your chance at it. If I do go I want to feel
that I&#8217;m not cheating you out of your opportunity. I like to have a clean
conscience. Here, Jack, you hold the straws. The one who gets the shorter stays
behind; that&#8217;s understood. And Steve shall draw first, because I picked
the straws.&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently, there could hardly be a more conscientious boy that Toby Hopkins,
for he was always looking out for the rights of the other fellow. That was the
main reason why Jack Winters had chosen him for one of his closest chums. He
knew he could depend on Toby to do the right thing every time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>Well, Steve had
the nerve deliberately to draw the short straw. He grinned when he discovered
what luck he had had, as though not so very much displeased after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it right, Toby,&#8221; he went on to say, pleasantly.
&#8220;&#8217;Course it&#8217;ll seem like an everlastingly long time while I&#8217;m
loafing here, but my heel is going to have a fair chance to get well. Then
I&#8217;ve got that bully book, which I can enjoy if the weather gets real warm,
so I won&#8217;t shiver at descriptions of the terrible times they had when
nearly freezing to death in the ice packs. Oh! don&#8217;t look like you pitied
me; I&#8217;m just as well satisfied it worked out that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did a good many things that afternoon. Jack got his camera in order for
further work, because, of course, he meant to carry it along with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you want to take the gun, too?&#8221; asked Steve, with a touch
of solicitude in his manner; for he rather counted on having the firearm with
him in camp, as a sort of protection that would serve to ease his mind; because
it would be a pretty lonely night of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll leave that for you, Steve,&#8221; said Jack,
immediately, as though all that had been settled in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about your meals?&#8221; Steve now asked. &#8220;If you expect to
be gone over night, it&#8217;ll mean that three or four times you&#8217;ll want
to break your fast. What sort of grub do you mean to carry <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span> along with you that doesn&#8217;t need
cooking; for I take it you&#8217;ll hardly expect to make a fire, for fear of
being discovered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right about the fire part of it, Steve,&#8221; Jack
informed him; &#8220;as for our food, I&#8217;ve arranged all that. You see, we
fetched along a number of things that will come in handy for such a trip. In the
first place, we&#8217;ll carry a lot of sweet chocolate; that always sustains a
fellow when he&#8217;s weak from hunger. Then there&#8217;s that big hunk of
fine dried beef, which I&#8217;m particularly fond of, and can eat just as I cut
it from the strip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians always used to carry pemmican along with them, to munch on
when going into the enemy&#8217;s country where a fire would endanger their
lives,&#8221; announced Toby. &#8220;And this modern dried beef is something
like the venison they smoked and cured until it was fairly black. They say a
redskin could travel all day on just a handful of maize or corn, and as much
pemmican; stopping to quench his thirst at some running stream or
spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several other things we have with us that we can carry to
help out in the food line,&#8221; Jack continued. &#8220;You must know that they
have malted milk that only needs water to make a splendid and nourishing drink.
Besides, there is desiccated egg in the shape of powder that is the real thing
preserved. I have also several tins of soup that I can heat up day or night
without a trace of fire.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_144'></a>144</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s a queer thing, Jack,&#8221;
spoke up Toby; &#8220;tell us how the thing is done, won&#8217;t you
please?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack stepped over to the supply wagon and soon returned bearing one of the
tins in question, which Toby noticed now was a trifle more bulky than others
that he remembered seeing containing prepared soups.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is quite a clever idea,&#8221; proceeded Jack. &#8220;You see, it
consists of really two cans, one inside the other. The narrow space between is
filled with unslacked lime. When you feel like having a meal, all you have to do
is to punch a hole close to the edge on top, and pour in some cold water. This
immediately makes the lime furiously hot, and in a short time you can open the
main can and your soup is almost scalding. I tried one can at home, and it
worked to a charm. My dad was quite tickled with it, and said they never had
such splendid things when he was young and used to go off into the woods on
camping or surveying trips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I see we&#8217;re not going to starve yet awhile, even if we
can&#8217;t have a nice pot of coffee while on the job,&#8221; laughed the
pleased Toby, handling the wonderfully self-heating can of vegetable soup almost
reverently.</p>

<p>So the afternoon passed.</p>

<p>Jack had everything laid out, for, as he said, it might be well for them to
get an early start on the following morning, since they had quite a tramp before
them, and would want to take their <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_145'></a>145</span> time during the latter half of the journey, when
there might be more or less danger of discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Jack assured them, &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to
keep this sort of thing up all the time we&#8217;re here in camp. That would be
making it too much a matter of business. Once I&#8217;ve settled on what this
Mr. Maurice is doing, and managed to gather up all the evidence necessary, I
shall put him out of my mind; and after that we&#8217;ll just enjoy ourselves to
the limit, as we deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Toby; &#8220;and if ever any fellows had a better
chance to enjoy themselves I&#8217;d like to know it; with such a splendid tent
for a shelter, a jolly camp stove that keeps you warm in chilly or wet weather;
and ten days left that can all be filled with delight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that we&#8217;ve another cause for rejoicing in the
possession of a most delightful stock of things to eat,&#8221; interrupted
Steve, sagely, &#8220;as well as a real biscuit and flapjack <i>chef</i>
who&#8217;s willing to lay himself out to the limit for the good of his
chums.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest of the day proved all that could be desired. It warmed up
considerably, too, although when the sun had set in a blaze of glory, and
evening began to steal softly upon the scene, there was a little tang to the air
that made the campfire, built outdoors, feel doubly acceptable to them.</p>

<p>Nor were they disturbed at all during the night that followed. Moses, being
well looked after, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
found no opportunity to slip his tether, and surprise them with a nocturnal
visit. Doubtless it was not from lack of trying that he failed to make a second
attack upon the oat-sack in the wagon, for fond memories of that other occasion
must still linger with him, to judge from the pitiful whinnies he gave vent to
from time to time throughout the night.</p>

<p>Once Toby awakened the other two by talking. He fancied he had heard another
of those strange booming sounds; but as Jack, who was a light sleeper, declared
he had caught no such dull crash, it was determined that Toby must have been
dreaming.</p>

<p>So morning found them.</p>

<p>Toby being the first to crawl out immediately announced that the signs were
all propitious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to be a fine day, Jack,&#8221; he went on to say, &#8220;though
I reckon it&#8217;ll warm up more or less along toward noon. But I&#8217;m so
glad the rain has gone that I&#8217;ll willingly stand any amount of heat
instead. Come, get a move on you, Steve; I&#8217;m starting up the cooking fire,
and you promised us we would have a batch of flapjacks this morning,
remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I did in a rash moment,&#8221; blustered Steve, making his
appearance, clad in his wonderfully striped pajamas; &#8220;and as I always try
to keep my word I reckon I&#8217;m in for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you&#8217;ll have it easy enough while we&#8217;re gone,&#8221;
Toby told him, &#8220;with only one to look <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_147'></a>147</span> after. Perhaps now you&#8217;ll be glad to see us
come trailing back home again some time tomorrow afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No question about that, Toby,&#8221; the other told him, as he
commenced with his customary early morning exercises, modeled somewhat after the
type of those in use in the army, and which were best calculated to take all the
stiffness and numbness out of his system, brought about by curling up under his
blanket.</p>

<p>There was really little to do save eat breakfast, since Jack had looked after
all necessary preparations on the previous afternoon. Steve did not seem quite
so hilarious as usual, Jack could not but notice. He understood the reason why,
and while he hated to think of leaving the other behind, it was really
necessary, since the camp must be guarded during their absence.</p>

<p>Later on the pair prepared to sally forth. Steve allowed the breakfast things
to lie around, promising to look after them when he had seen the last of his two
departing chums. Toby had filled his pockets with crackers and cheese, in
addition to the amount of other things which he was to carry as his share of the
burden. It looked as though Toby did not mean to starve to death during his
absence from the fountain head of supplies. But then Toby did not differ to any
great extent from any other wholesome boy with an appetite that knew no limit.
Steve even urged various other edibles upon the adventures until one would think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span> they were planning
to be gone a whole week or more, instead of a scant two days.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve overlooked anything,&#8221; asserted
Toby, as they drew up to make their start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if we hang around here much longer we&#8217;ll be having the
entire supply of grub shoved on us,&#8221; laughed Jack, quite amused by
Steve&#8217;s generosity; &#8220;so I guess we&#8217;d better say goodbye, and
clear out while the going is good. Take care of yourself, Steve, and have as
easy a time as you can. You&#8217;ll get your chance to navigate after we come
back again, and must try the fishing with Toby here for a starter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So-long, fellows, and the best of luck go with you!&#8221; called out
Steve, as they launched upon their journey, Toby with a stout staff, and Jack
having his camera dangling over his shoulder by the strap.</p>

<p>He stood there watching them plunge into the depths of the woods. Every time
one of them glanced back Steve would wave his hat to show that he still watched.
There was a trace of regret in his manner, though he had bravely tried to hide
it from Jack&#8217;s observing eye. Of course Steve hated to see them go away to
stay so long; it would be mighty lonely in camp all by himself; and the coming
of night could not be expected to give him a great amount of cheer.</p>

<p>But then Steve was a sensible chap, capable of making the best of a bad
bargain. He would find plenty to do to amuse himself; and as a last resort <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span> he had that entertaining
volume, only one-quarter read up to now, upon which he could depend to make the
time pass. So after they had vanished from his vision Steve turned around and
proceeded to clean up the breakfast things for a starter.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>INSIDE THE ENEMY&#8217;S LINES</span></h2>

<p>Jack and Toby pushed on through the woods. Having been over the course much
of the way before, going and returning, they would find it much easier than if
everything was strange to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use trying to see our trail, is there, Jack?&#8221; the other had
remarked after they were fairly started on their way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it would have to be a pretty deep lot of tracks that would not
be washed out in all that downpour of steady rain,&#8221; Jack advised him.
&#8220;But then there are scores of other things by means of which we&#8217;ll
be able to know we are going over about the same route as before. For instance,
you remember seeing that stone yonder, that seems to be so neatly balanced on
another larger one, just as if human hands had placed it there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course I do, and we even stopped to look at it closer,&#8221;
replied Toby. &#8220;I called it Saddle Rock, because the top does resemble a
saddle a whole lot. Yes, and I shall be on the lookout for that remarkable
looking tree that made us think of a camel&#8217;s hump, it was so curved. It
wasn&#8217;t a great way beyond these same rocks, if I&#8217;m not off my
bearings.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll run across it before ten minutes
more,&#8221; commented Jack; and sure enough that was just what they did.</p>

<p>So, thanks to the habit of observing things all the time, they were enabled
to follow their former course just as unerringly as though they had been picking
up a well-beaten trail.</p>

<p>Of course they talked of many things as they trudged along, for as yet there
was no positive reason which made it necessary for them to keep quiet. That
would come later on, when they drew nearer the danger zone.</p>

<p>As often happened Toby&#8217;s thoughts ran back in a groove and centred
about the home country. It was only natural that this should be so; for no
sooner are boys off on a vacation trip before home, which may have seemed very
monotonous before, with its school duties, and the many restrictions on their
liberty, begins to assume a highly magnified place in their concern. As the old
saying has it, &#8220;you never miss the water till the well runs dry,&#8221;
and boys become so accustomed to accepting the comforts of home that they fail
to appreciate them until all of a sudden they find themselves cast upon their
own resources, and face to face with responsibilities they may never have
dreamed of before.</p>

<p>From time to time the faces of all his Chester comrades had a fashion of
rising up before Toby, and he could even imagine himself talking with them,
perhaps relating some of the lively happenings <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_152'></a>152</span> of that two weeks in the woods up in the wonderful
Pontico Hills country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got to thinking yesterday afternoon, while dozing there in the
tent,&#8221; Toby remarked at one time, &#8220;and wondering just what sort of
an eleven Chester could put in the field this Fall. Some of us have had a little
practice at football work, but other promising players would have to begin right
at the start, and learn all there is to the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That can be done easily enough,&#8221; Jack informed him. &#8220;Fact
is, it&#8217;s a more simple thing to start right in the beginning, than to have
to undo some false notions, for let a fellow once get into a certain habit, and
it&#8217;s hard to break him of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing we can count ourselves lucky over, Jack; that&#8217;s having
such a good coach as old Joe Hooker. He used to be a crackerjack football player
in his day; and it was a good deal owing to his work with the nine that Chester
won through with Harmony in baseball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all give old Joe most of the credit,&#8221; Jack told him, bluntly;
&#8220;and he&#8217;s promised to whip the eleven into a smoothly running team
before the season begins. Inside of two months, or soon after school opens
again, there&#8217;ll be pretty lively doings in Chester, with the squad out for
drill nearly every afternoon. All of us have got to get as hard as nails, so we
can stand every kind of thumping without weakening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you made out any sort of list so far, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span> Jack, as to who&#8217;s going to get a
chance for the big eleven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a list of all available candidates, if that&#8217;s what you
mean, Toby; but no selection can possibly be made until they&#8217;ve all had a
chance to show what&#8217;s in them. Some who don&#8217;t seem to promise a
great deal in the start will surprise everybody before they&#8217;ve been at
work a week. On the other hand there will be bitter disappointments in the
bunch, and fellows on whom I&#8217;ve depended may fail to come up to the
scratch and qualify.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I certainly hope I&#8217;m not one of that lot,&#8221; said
Toby, between his set teeth, since his heart had long been yearning for a chance
to shine on the gridiron as a particular star, to hear the roar of plaudits from
the vast crowd assembled, when fortune allowed him to make some sensational play
that would advance his side closer to final victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody can tell until the test comes, what they will be able to do,
Toby. For my part I shall be bitterly sorry if both you and Steve do not make
the team. And then there&#8217;s Big Bob Jeffries, who ought to be a magnificent
full-back; while long-legged Joel Jackman, and Fred Badger should shine as right
and left tackle. Besides, I&#8217;d surely love to see Phil Parker, Herbert
Jones and Hugh McGuffey pull through, because they&#8217;re all good fellows,
and with the right sort of grit to do well in football.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>&#8220;I know
I&#8217;m going to be on needles and pins up to the time the final selection is
made,&#8221; affirmed Toby. &#8220;And you&#8217;d better believe I want to go
in, if at all, on my honest individual merits. No favoritism can ever be
tolerated in football, where a single weak link in the chain spells ultimate
defeat for the team, no matter how strong the other ten men may be. The opposing
players can quickly learn where the soft snap lies, and after that will devote
all their efforts to tearing a hole through the ranks just there where the line
will give way soonest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Game words for you to speak, Toby,&#8221; commented Jack, full of
satisfaction over the thought of having such an honest chum, whose every
interest was for the glory of his team, rather than a desire to make an
individual reputation, regardless of the general good.</p>

<p>Later on they found themselves at a well-remembered spot. The morning was
fairly well advanced by that time. Toby was looking around him eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, wasn&#8217;t it right about here we were held up by that onery
cat the other afternoon, Jack?&#8221; he asked, with a trace of excitement in
his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the tree right over in front of us, in which she was
located when we first heard her angry snarls and spitting,&#8221; his companion
told him. &#8220;But that&#8217;s no sign at all the beast is anywhere near here
now. For all we know she may be ten or a dozen miles away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>&#8220;I hope
so, anyhow,&#8221; honest Toby hastily remarked; but he still continued to cast
nervous glances to the right and to the left as they pushed slowly forward,
keeping to the open line of the little ridge.</p>

<p>Several times something gave him a start. Now it was a rabbit that, without
warning, leaped from a clump of grass, and darted away with long bounds. Then a
bird flew up from a bush, and the sound of its wings made Toby unconsciously
remember the singular spitting noise which the mottled cat with the ears that
lay back on her head gave utterance to, as she warned them to advance no further
on penalty of being clawed.</p>

<p>But they were not attacked. The neighborhood just then seemed singularly free
from malignant four-footed enemies armed with sharp teeth and nails. A
dun-colored object just vanishing in a sink some little distance away Toby
identified as an extra large fox that had been aroused from his noonday nap by
the rustle of footsteps amidst the foliage, or the murmur of their lowered
voices. No one made any attempt to interfere with the retreat of Reynard;
indeed, they carried no weapon that could have halted his flight, even though
inclined that way, which was far from being the case.</p>

<p>Remembering that when stopped on the previous occasion they had had reason to
believe they must be within a mile or so of the region from whence those
singular blasting noises proceeded, the two scouts from that time on slowed down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span> their pace and
maintained a more vigilant watch than ever, particularly keeping an eye ahead
for any sign of enemies.</p>

<p>It was Toby, it chanced, who made a discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand still, Jack, and look through this vista ahead of us.
Isn&#8217;t that a man I can see standing there, with a gun in his
hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what it is, Toby, and from his actions I&#8217;d say he is some
sort of sentry or vidette, who is busy watching the open trail we&#8217;ve been
following for so long, as it seems to be a sort of woods thoroughfare, possibly
running to the bank of the river somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks suspicious, doesn&#8217;t it, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if they&#8217;re up to some business that they do not want
to be discovered at,&#8221; came the low reply. &#8220;I suppose that Mr.
Dangerfield, learning of our presence in the woods, and that we&#8217;re all
from Chester, is afraid that we may take a notion to wander over this way; and
he has that guard stationed there to warn us back. Perhaps he&#8217;d tell some
sort of stiff story about Uncle Sam conducting an experimental proving station
with aerial torpedoes, or something like that, up here; and that no one is
allowed to set a foot on the ground under a severe penalty. But we&#8217;ll take
care to give that guard a wide berth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must mean we&#8217;ll navigate around him, make a wide circle, so
to speak, eh, Jack?&#8221; asked Toby, thrilled with the prospect of soon
finding himself within the lines of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;Yes, and
right here is where we must begin the operation,&#8221; Jack announced.
&#8220;We can take his bearings, and cut around on the right, where the cover
seems to be exceptionally good and heavy. No hurry about it either, remember,
Toby. We must make sure of our ground as we go. Given half an hour, and we ought
to have left the vidette handsomely in the lurch.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was very exciting, so Toby thought. Secretly he deplored the fact that
their only gun had to be left in camp with Steve. He would have felt better
could he but know they had some means of defense with them. However, Jack
evidently did not intend allowing anything to arise necessitating such action.
He expected to be able to carry out his little spying expedition without
betraying the fact of their presence to any of the enemy.</p>

<p>Once they had circled around and come upon the open stretch again they kept
stealing forward. When once more they heard the deep-toned bark of that dog,
Jack stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must change our course again, Toby,&#8221; he announced, briefly;
&#8220;the wind is striking us on the right cheek, when it should be dead ahead;
or that beast will soon be getting our scent. So let&#8217;s strike off here,
and make another half circuit; when we can push ahead, and reach our goal
unchallenged.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE COMING OF THE CRISIS</span></h2>

<p>It was now after three by the sun, Jack judged, after flinging a look up
toward the king of day, shining powerfully half-way down the western sky. There
would be plenty of time for them to do what spying they wished, and then,
seeking some retired spot, pass the night quietly. When another day came they
could lay their plans accordingly.</p>

<p>They found some little difficulty in making the turn, for in places the
undergrowth was so dense as to delay their progress considerably. Jack had taken
his measures for the flank movement, and knew just when they had gone far
enough. The passing air fanning his cheek told him that much. Besides,
occasionally they heard some sign from the dog; which Jack judged must be tied
up, from the fretful character of his mouthings. There is all the difference in
the world between the cheerful bark of a hound free to go and come, and the
depressed utterance of one that is fastened to kennel or tree by rope or
chain.</p>

<p>Thus another half hour slipped by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear voices, Jack,&#8221; whispered the trembling Toby, when they
had been creeping forward for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_159'></a>159</span> some little time after resuming their forward
progress.</p>

<p>The other did not reply, only pressed a forefinger upon his lips, and nodded
his head in the affirmative. Toby understood from this that communications
between them were to be exceedingly limited in scope from that time on; and when
necessary, must be made in the most cautious of tones.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards they had a glimpse of moving objects some little distance
beyond. They could easily make them out to be several men, roughly dressed as a
rule, and who seemed to be rushing this way and that as though laboring under
considerable stress of excitement.</p>

<p>But both boys saw more than that. Reared against the low sky-line was a
skeleton framework made of timbers. Jack had never actually seen an oil derrick
before in his life, but he knew that this was one. Undoubtedly their guess had
been a true one. Maurice Dangerfield, the unscrupulous nephew of Miss Priscilla,
was so convinced there was oil to be found on her property that he had entered
into an arrangement with some experienced parties accustomed to putting down
wells to make an experimental boring, and the skeleton framework had been used
in carrying out the said sinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone and done it, as sure as anything, Jack,&#8221;
whispered Toby, feeling that it was still safe to do this, since the men were
all at some little distance from them; and moreover seemed <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span> completely engrossed with what gripped
their attention. &#8220;That&#8217;s an oil derrick and they&#8217;ve sunk a
trial well. Isn&#8217;t it so, Jack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No question about it, Toby. We must move around a dozen feet, so as to
find fresh cover; then we&#8217;ll keep on creeping up. I&#8217;d like above
everything to get close enough to snap off a picture of that derrick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you must, Jack,&#8221; breathed Toby, instantly falling in with
the scheme, as he usually did with anything originating in his companion&#8217;s
fertile brain. &#8220;Once they saw that thing, with Mr. Maurice standing near
the foot of the same, there&#8217;d be no trouble convincing a jury he was
guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack lost no further time. He appeared quite anxious to close in before the
sun got too low in the heavens to allow a good strong picture. The wind
continued to favor them as before; and all doubt about the dog being tied up was
removed when once they had caught a glimpse of the beast sitting disconsolately
on his haunches in front of what appeared to be a rude kennel made from the
hollow butt of a big tree.</p>

<p>All the while they were thus creeping up they could hear the men calling out
to one another. Jack suspected from the excited tenor of their conversation that
some great crisis was drawing near. He watched them working at the foot of the
derrick, and soon had convictions concerning the nature of their labor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>Unable to resist
the temptation to learn whether his suspicions regarding the presence of oil
deep down in the earth were well founded or not, and possibly urged on also by
some speculator whom he had taken into the secret, Dangerfield had finally
consented to &#8220;shoot&#8221; the well, and settle the question once for
all.</p>

<p>Apparently a kind Fate had led Jack and Toby to the spot just when the crisis
was reached. They were likely to witness the operation and learn the result,
though uninvited, and unwelcome guests.</p>

<p>By degrees they managed to get close enough up to suit the purposes of the
intending photographer. If they ventured any further they ran a great risk of
being seen by one of the men, or else scented by the keen nose of the dog.
Already Jack could see from the actions of the beast that his suspicions had
been aroused. He no longer sat there as before, watching the men, but walked up
and down from side to side as far as his tether would allow, sniffing the air in
a significant manner, and occasionally giving a doleful howl; at which one of
the workers would turn to make a threatening gesture, and call out angrily at
him.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly every one of them must be worked up to a state of nervous
tension, and the actions of the dog irritated his owner.</p>

<p>From the way in which Jack now commenced to act Toby knew he was getting
ready to snap off a picture. He picked away the green leaves <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span> in front of him so as to
allow of a small round opening. Through this he expected to sight his camera,
and get the oil derrick in focus; after which a slight click would announce that
his object had been accomplished.</p>

<p>Toby crouched there, fairly holding his breath. He knew that Jack did not
wish any further attempt to be made to hold even the briefest of conversations.
Toby, bound to witness whatever was going on out there in the open, had copied
the example set by his comrade, and picked away the leaves that intervened,
allowing himself an admirable peephole.</p>

<p>Here he knelt and watched and waited. Jack evidently was quite particular. He
undoubtedly wanted his picture to be an excellent one, and would not risk
failure through being in too great a hurry. It seemed to the impatient Toby that
an hour must have passed since they ensconced themselves in their present
location, when he just faintly caught the anticipated click that announced the
accomplishment of Jack&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Twisting his head slightly around Toby could see his chum calmly turning the
film so as to bring another blank in line for a second shot. Jack believed in
making sure of such an important picture. Far better to waste good films than to
find that he had failed to get as clear a negative as he wished.</p>

<p>Again he snapped off the scene, doubtless with the idea of catching
Dangerfield in full view, with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_163'></a>163</span> his face exposed toward the camera, so that he
might be readily recognized by one who knew him as well as his aunt did.</p>

<p>Nor did Jack stop there, but prepared for a third exposure. When he did not
press the bulb, but only held himself in readiness to do at a second&#8217;s
warning, Toby suddenly grasped what must undoubtedly be in the other&#8217;s
mind. Jack meant to try his best to secure a picture of the
&#8220;shooting&#8221; of the oil well, if such a thing lay within the bounds of
possibility! It was a splendid idea, and fairly staggered Toby by its immensity;
but then Jack always aimed high, and dared attempt things that might seem far
beyond attainment when viewed through the eyes of other boys.</p>

<p>Well, whatever was in the wind, Toby thought, it would not be long in
developing now, judging from the increased tension out there where men were
running back and forth, calling to each other, and some of them removing
valuable instruments used in the boring as though to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Yes, it was coming, and hidden there in their leafy retreat he and Jack would
be able to witness the great event. Toby was ready to call himself an
exceedingly lucky fellow, to be given this wonderful privilege, it must have
seemed a momentous thing even had they been present with the knowledge of those
oil workers; but the fact of lying concealed and spying upon the group, added
immensely to the thrill of the situation, Toby thought.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>Now and again he
would shoot an apprehensive glance in the direction of the dog. Toby did not
exactly like the looks of the beast, nor his actions either. Plainly the animal
shared the excitement of the men, or else he suspected the presence of intruders
near by, and was becoming wild to break loose and find them.</p>

<p>He jumped from side to side, and strained at his tether violently, while
uttering sharp, snappy barks, and low vicious growls. His master, not
comprehending what ailed the animal, picked up a stick and advanced toward him
threateningly; whereat the beast crept into his stump kennel; only to come out
again almost immediately and strain to get loose once more.</p>

<p>Toby was greatly exercised lest that rope give way. If such a thing happened
he knew it would be all up with himself and Jack, for they would have to defend
themselves against the hound&#8217;s teeth, and must inevitably be made
prisoners by some of the men.</p>

<p>What would happen then was an unpleasant thought for Toby to entertain. Why,
it might be they would be kept there until Maurice had been to see Priscilla,
and coaxed her to give him an option on the property; which would really be too
bad. So Toby hoped, and watched, and waited, to see the climax, his attention
divided between the hound dog and the oil derrick, where the cluster of men
moved to and fro.</p>

<p>The minutes were &#8220;shod with lead,&#8221; according <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span> to Toby&#8217;s notion, and he ought to
know what that meant, after his recent experience along the line of anxiety; if
something did not happen pretty soon he feared he would be worked up to such a
pitch that he must give a yell, or burst. And then again, unless the great event
came about inside of fifteen or twenty minutes surely Jack would be unable to
get the kind of picture on which his heart was set.</p>

<p>Then Toby fell rigid, and stared again through his peephole. The men were
hurrying away from the vicinity of the derrick now! Plainly the stage was set
for the closing scene of the strange little woods drama, and the time had
arrived to make use of the electric battery in order to fire the dynamite
cartridge lowered into the hole from which the boring tool had been lifted.</p>

<p>Toby held his breath from very awe, and pressed his face still further into
the leafy screen. No danger of discovery now, since those men were one and all
watching the derrick, as though it were a magnet that held their attention as
the North Pole draws the needle of the mariner&#8217;s compass.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a quiver to the earth, and a dull deep-seated roar. Then
an unseen giant arose in his might, and tossed the derrick upwards as though it
were composed of mere straws. With the flying timbers came what seemed to be a
stream of dirty water, flying far up in the air, as though a fireman&#8217;s
hose had been turned on! <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_166'></a>166</span> That must be the dark-looking crude oil, mingled
with water, Toby conjectured, as he continued to gape and wonder. Then after all
the suspicions of Maurice Dangerfield had proven true, and the Pontico Hills
region did harbor rich deposits of valuable oil!</p>

<p>He hoped Jack had been equal to the emergency, and pressed the rubber bulb of
his camera just at the instant when remnants of the dislocated derrick, and that
rush of precious mineral oil stood out against the eastern heavens so
wonderfully clear!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>OUT OF THE WOODS&#8211;CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s get away from here while the going is good,&#8221;
said Jack in the ear of his companion, after he had taken yet another view of
the scene, with the excited men running forward toward the sprouting oil well,
which possibly they might later on seek to plug up, if such a thing were
possible.</p>

<p>Toby was nothing loth. He had seen all he wanted, and still feared lest that
hound dog might either break loose, or else be given his liberty by his master,
either case meaning immediate trouble and exposure for the two lads.</p>

<p>Once they had withdrawn to some little distance and they could increase their
pace, Jack seemed to be fairly bubbling over with delight, since all his plans
had worked out so admirably. If those pictures only turned out as well as he
anticipated he expected to have a pretty spread to show Miss Priscilla Haydock
when once more he sought an interview with her. And certainly the clever schemes
of the plotting nephew would be nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we heading for the camp, Jack?&#8221; asked Toby, a little
nervously, because he knew a long and arduous journey stared them in the face,
much of which would have to be undertaken after night <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span> had fallen; and the prospect of going
through those dark wildcat-infested woods in the gloom, even with a little
electric torch to aid them, was far from a pleasing thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s no need of our hurrying like that,&#8221; the other
told him, greatly to Toby&#8217;s delight. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just go a mile or
so further on, and hunt up a retired gully, where we can make a little fire if
we want it, and pass the night in true hunters&#8217; style.&#8221;</p>

<p>This they proceeded to do. There was no difficulty about finding just such a
gully, because there were dozens from which to make a selection. And the chances
of their being discovered seemed negligible, according to Jack. Still, on the
way he took some pains to lose the scent by having Toby copy his example, and
wading for some little distance along in a brook. Water leaves no trail that a
dog can follow, and so Jack felt that he was making things additionally secure
by taking this trouble.</p>

<p>They had their fire, and warmed some water in a cup Jack carried; with which
they made a mess of malted milk. It was not equal to fragrant coffee, both boys
agreed, but better than cold water.</p>

<p>So they sat there munching their supper, and exchanging comments. There was
much of interest to talk about, for the wonderful things they had just witnessed
would always remain fresh in their memories.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_169'></a>169</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll develop the film as soon as I
can,&#8221; Jack was saying later on, after the shades of night had gathered
around them, and they allowed the little fire to go out as an insurance against
discovery through its glow, which might be seen some distance away. &#8220;Then
if things turn out well I might take a run down to town, leaving the camp in
charge of you fellows for a day, and hurrying back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean with old Moses to take you?&#8221; asked Toby,
incredulously; &#8220;you&#8217;d have to figure on two days at his rate of
travel, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ve got a scheme that can beat that all hollow,&#8221;
laughed the boy who was forever observing things, and turning them to his
advantage when the occasion or the necessity arose. &#8220;Down the road three
miles you remember we saw the last farm, and quite an extensive one at that. I
paid particular attention to the fact that the owner had a flivver of a car in
his shed, as most farmers do in these enlightened days. I&#8217;ll pay him well
to take me to Chester and back. He can be doing some errand in town while
waiting for me. And since we&#8217;re not limited as to money in a game that
might mean hundreds of thousands to Miss Priscilla, I&#8217;m sure I can get my
ride, if I have to coax the farmer with a promise of twenty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had a quiet night, though from time to time when he chanced to be awake
Toby listened to the barking of the hound dog with a little trace of his former
apprehension. But nothing happened <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_170'></a>170</span> to disturb them, and with the coming of morning
they made another small fire, at which they prepared a warm drink from the
malted milk; and even after a fashion had a queer tasting omelette, using some
of the egg powder with milk added. Toby made a grimace while eating, but
nevertheless finished his share of the omelette that had been cooked on a smooth
flat stone, placed over the red-hot embers of the fire.</p>

<p>Afterwards they set out for camp. Trudging along steadily, and without any
going astray, the pair finally arrived just when Steve was busying himself in
getting up a midday meal, and wisely cooking enough for three while about
it.</p>

<p>Of course Steve was wild to hear what had happened. And as it would be cruel
to keep the poor fellow in suspense, after he had so willingly stayed at home,
Jack told him what they had seen and accomplished.</p>

<p>Steve was delighted. He danced a regular sailor&#8217;s hornpipe upon hearing
how the several pictures had been snapped off, while the men remained in utter
ignorance of the presence of the two boys near by.</p>

<p>Toby, too, related how nervous the barking dog had made him, and how much he
had feared lest the beast break loose, and disclose their presence back of that
leafy screen.</p>

<p>Once the midday meal had been disposed of Jack busied himself with his
daylight developing tank. Toby hovered near, and seemed just as anxious <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span> as could be concerning
the ultimate results. When Jack showed him the negatives, looking particularly
clear in blacks and whites, Toby gave a whoop of pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll make dandy pictures, believe me, Jack!&#8221; he cried,
after closely examining the roll of film the other was holding up, after fixing
the same, and starting to wash the hypo off. &#8220;Why, I warrant you, with a
magnifying glass there&#8217;ll be no trouble at all in identifying that Maurice
and his crowd one by one, as they were nearly all facing the camera when you
shut it off. And say, you&#8217;ve caught the pyramid of timbers and oil and
stones just at its height! Shake hands on the strength of your big scoop,
Jack!&#8221;</p>

<p>The artist himself fairly beamed with joy. He knew that he had met with
abounding success in his task, which had been one few professional photographers
could have accomplished as well.</p>

<p>He meant to dry the film that afternoon, and if the sun remained strong
enough he could make some prints. If not, possibly he might succeed with his
little electric hand-torch after darkness had come.</p>

<p>In the end he managed to secure all he required, and just as Toby had said
they turned out to be splendid pictures.</p>

<p>When morning came Jack started off along the logging road, bound for the
thoroughfare which led to Chester, many miles away. He found the farmer ready to
make twenty dollars for a day&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_172'></a>172</span> run to Chester, and reached town inside of two
hours after leaving camp. His chums were pleased to see him show up before four
o&#8217;clock that afternoon and his radiant face told that everything had gone
well with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Priscilla was delighted with my report, and the pictures,&#8221;
he went on to tell the others, as they came crowding around him. &#8220;She
promised not to do anything until we came back to town, for she didn&#8217;t
want to spoil our vacation outing, she said, and if her vicious nephew once
learned that his big scheme for a fortune had fallen through on account of our
work up here, he might feel disposed to do us some bodily injury. But she says
she&#8217;ll keep him on the anxious seat yet awhile. She is quite angry at him
for this nasty trick of his. If he had come to her honestly and told her of his
discovery, she says she would have gladly given him a good interest in the
property, and allowed him to have charge of the opening of the new oil district;
but since he tried to cheat her out of the whole business she will turn him down
flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what he deserves, for a fact!&#8221; ventured Toby.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a bad egg, according to my notion; and I guess his aunt knows
it pretty well, too. I warrant you she&#8217;s had some unpleasant experiences
with Mr. Maurice before this. But I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re all on deck again.
Now tomorrow we&#8217;ll start in to enjoy ourselves after our own fashion.
Playing the spy may be very exciting work, but <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_173'></a>173</span> say, it isn&#8217;t just what appeals to me as the
finest thing going. You feel a bit cheap looking in on folks, just as if you
were peeping through a keyhole. Steve, are you with me for a turn at the black
bass in the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling fish hungry, if that answers your question,
Toby,&#8221; replied the other: &#8220;and I&#8217;m laying out to go across
country with you tomorrow to see what the Paradise River looks like away up
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It can be seen from this that the three boys had now cast all anxieties to
the wind, and meant to have a jolly time of it during the remainder of their
stay up among the Pontico Hills. It was a great relief to do away with suspicion
and spying, which really had no part in such a genuine woods outing.</p>

<p>They had plenty of little adventures during the remainder of their camping
experience, but nothing of great moment happened; and in due time old Moses drew
the party all the way back home again, browned from their days in the sun and
air, and with a renewed appetite for the home cooking. Camp fare is all very
fine for a spell, but oh! how delightful do those doughnuts, cookies, apple pies
and all similar dainties taste to growing, healthy boys, after two weeks spent
in the woods!</p>

<p>Maurice Dangerfield found himself balked in his designs, and was glad to
accept the really generous amount of money which his aunt offered <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span> him, at the same time
being told that she never wished to see him again after his duplicity. She did
this because she felt under certain obligations to the man for having been the
first to discover the presence of oil on her vast holdings of property.</p>

<p>Before many weeks had gone by there were several wells being put down, and
the Pontico Hills region began to have a very oily smell, that sometimes could
be detected away down in Chester when the breeze was favorable. And Miss
Priscilla urged Jack and his chums to accept a generous present from her, with
more to follow as time developed the value of the new discovery, which their
timely assistance had saved from falling into the hands of the unscrupulous Mr.
Maurice.</p>

<p>During the balance of the summer vacation Jack and Toby and Steve enjoyed
many little outings that afforded them considerable profit in the way of
information, as well as pleasure. Like most of the other boys of Chester,
however, they were head and ears interested in the progress of the new building
that was being erected, and which when completed would be used as a gymnasium,
where they could have the time of their lives amidst such appurtenances as go to
make up a first-class physical culture department.</p>

<p>With the first breath of Autumn, and the taking up of school duties came the
long anticipated season of outdoor Fall sports. The sound of the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span> &#8220;punk&#8221; of
the football kicked hither and thither over the green sward told what was in the
wind. And the title of our next story will explain how those boys of Chester
were eager to win more victories for their home town. You will find it all set
down in the pages of &#8220;Jack Winters&#8217; Gridiron Chums; or When the
Halfback Saved the Day.&#8221;</p>
